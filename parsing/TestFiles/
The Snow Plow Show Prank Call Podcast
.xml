<description>
What the hell is this thing I put together today? I don't even know.  It's got old pranks that you've probably heard before from the early 2000's and it's got music by Jem.  Yeah, you know, that really popular singer that everyone has heard of.  The pranks are the old incoming calls from movie theater customers, auto parts customers and pizza customers.  I've been out of town for the past week, so this was my attempt to put something out there since I couldn't do live shows away from the PLA Situation Room.  I put out a show on the secret feed too, for you supporters, which also isn't typical Snow Plow Show stuff.  I know you'll probably hate the music - it's a bit more irritating than I remembered from 12 years ago.  But I tried, right?  RIGHT??  It was fun to revisit these pranks and clean up the audio on them, so hopefully you'll enjoy them too, especially if you haven't heard them before.

Luckily for you podcast listeners, I've cut most of that all out so I don't get sued.  Thanks, Incognetoe and Aussie Jack for the numbers I called in this show.  I don't really hate them as much as I seem in this show.  Just a little.

Thanks to Rhapsodyman2000, only the first half of this show has new calls in it.  The second half plays a couple of classic Tenants From Hell calls from a year ago.

In today's show, sponsored by Ben Kilburn, we call a bunch of hotel guests and find out that pretty much all of them make more money in a day than I do in a month.

Here's a Friday night shoe that was originally going to be a preshow to The Art of Phone Larking, but Jiad's in jail so it ended up being a preshow to Neon Nites.  In this show we call some home owners, some rowing club members, and a few unruly church customers.

I always forget to name a sponsor for live shows and I just didn't feel like throwing a few voicemails in the middle of the show.  Originally this show was about 2 hours and 20 minutes long, but now it's just a bit over an hour, so when you hear me talking about what a great show it was, that's just me being sarcastic because over an hour of horrible horrible show had to be chopped out to make this one listenable.

<guid isPermaLink="false">Snow Plow Show – May 12th, 2015 – I've Got My Cact-Eye On You</guid>
<description>
Default Cecil's sponsorship has resulted in us discovering an amazing retired freestyle rapper in Paradise Valley, Arizona.  In today's show we try to clean up the reputation of hidden cactus cameras and we get an update on the post office that hates cripples and blind people.

Today Devon Gladden is responsible for the fusion of three talented broadcasters, which are Carlito, Mistress Morgan and RBCP.   This was a LIVE show, in which a fusion of ideas from the hosts and the listeners in the chat room were used to create lots of hilarity.  We also talked lovingly about our memories of Radio Shack and the fusion planned between them and Sprint and how much better a fusion between Radio Shack and Amazon would have been.  Fusion fusion fusion.
