    <title>HPR1935: Quick Bashpodder Fix</title>
    <author>catintp.nospam@nospam.yahoo.com (Charles in NJ)</author>
    <link>http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1935</link>
    <description><![CDATA[
Bashpodder is a great Bash script for downloading the latest episodes of podcasts and other media from their feeds.


There are a few feeds that are not handled properly by Bashpodder, namely, the TED Talks podcast feed and the NPR digest show called the TED Radio Hour.


The URLs for the audio files have a number of additional fields at the end of the string after the media file name, and Bashpodder picks up the last field as if it were the media file name for the show. So every TED Radio Hour episode is called &quot;510298&quot;. If you download more than one episode at a time, only the last episode to be saved will survive. Each new file clobbers the last one, because they all get the same filename.


Charles in NJ made a simple fix to Bashpodder.shell to correct this problem, and he shares it in this episode.

Disclaimer:

All characters are fictitious renditions of HPR contributers.
Nothing about any individuals character is based on anything other than my personal convenience of using their likenesses in fictitious storytelling.
No disrespect is intended in any way.

The genre that the character A Shadowy Figure lives in is hard boiled Noir.
Noir reflects a past history that had different standards than we do now.
I do not personally hold those antiquated world views. Nor do I promote them through this work of fiction. I would like to think this artistic creation does provide an opportunity to see how far we've come as a society.

But most of all, I'd like to think that you the listener, are entertained and/or inspired by this presentation.

Thank you all for your support.

    <title>HPR1933: HPR AudioBookClub 11 Street Candles</title>
    <author>admin.nospam@nospam.hackerpublicradio.org (HPR_AudioBookClub)</author>
    <link>http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1933</link>
    <description><![CDATA[SUMMARY
In this episode, the HPR_AudioBookClub reviews Street Candles by David Collins-Rivera. You can download this AudioBook for free from http://www.cavalcadeaudio.com/.
If you liked this book, or are a fan of David Collins-Rivera, you can purchase it from http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ADavid%20Collins-Rivera.
Pre-Spoilers

 Thaj: Great book. Makes me want to go back and re-read the previous book.  I wonder how well some of the commentary  present in this book will resonate in the future.  The story is good enough I have no doubt that it will still be a good read, but I'm not sure if it might loose a bit. 
 x1101: I Loved this book. So much so that I listened to it twice. Every chapter is a cliff hanger.
 pokey: I LOVE this AudioBook! The author (Lostinbronx) really made me care about each of the characters. Every chapter is a cliff hanger, and that WORKS precisely because I do care about the characters.
 pegwole: It was a fantastic post modern essay on life. Even though I listened to the wrong AudioBook.
 CrispyoneFifty: Speaking for all of humanity, to all of humanity's future, I say &quot;you should go download and listen to this AudioBook!&quot;

(summary)
BEVERAGE REVIEWS
As  usual, the HPR_AudioBookClub took some time to review the beverages that each of us were drinking during the episode

 Thaj: Running late, just drinking water.  I know LAME!
 x1101: Black Isle Organic Oatmeal Stout. Very little head, a cholate/coffee nose, as well as chocolate/coffee malt notes. Not overly fizzy, but not sudsy at all. Excellent. http://www.blackislebrewery.com/beer/Hibernator-Oatmeal-Stout.html
 pokey: I drank a Six Star Creatine fruit punch because I'm tired of looking like Ejoq. I have to go to the gym after the show, and this stuff seems to help with muscle recovery. It tastes pretty good. There's no funny artificial sweetener after taste, for which I'm very grateful. http://www.sixstarpro.com/products/creatinex3/
 pegwole: It's coffee. Its not a special one either, now shut up.
 CrispyoneFifty: Newcastle Werewolf Blood-Red Ale It's sweet up front, and leaves a sweet after taste, with a punch of bitter in between. You can definitely taste the rye in there too. http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/342/71106/

Spoilers Notes
x1101's mental image of Bin Ragensten http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tBCFYZpXFTE/ULLWzqZ0X9I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/-w4FEX8atL8/s1600/Santa-Claus-Rise-Of-The-Guardians-600x375.jpg 
OUR NEXT AUDIOBOOK
The Call of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft

    <title>HPR1930: A systemd primer</title>
    <author>clinton.roy.nospam@nospam.gmail.com (Clinton Roy)</author>
    <link>http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1930</link>
    <description><![CDATA[1 What is systemd?
A dependency system for unix services.
And, a set of basic unix services to make a unix system usable.
And, a growing list of not quite so basic services

NTP, networkd, timers (crond/atd)

From a programmers perspective, it’s the mainloop phenomenon.
2 Alternatives
Solaris: Service Management Facility
Mac OSX: launchd
Ubuntu: upstart (until recently)
3 Replaces
SYSV
LSB (actually implements LSB deps)
4 Terminology
units

[auto]mount
swap
path (inotify triggers)
socket
timer (crond/atd)
service
slice (cgroup)
pseudo
device
snapshot
scope



targets

replace run levels
default target at boot
can isolate to just one target

5 Advantages – Design
Proper, explicit dependencies between system compontents
Starts components in parallel
A proper separation of concerns, lots of situations covered.

configuration files are regular, simple to understand generally small
OTOH, there are LOTS of options

Configuration is not runnable shell.
[Unit]
Description=CUPS Scheduler
Documentation=man:cupsd(8)

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cupsd -l
Type=simple

[Install]
Also=cups.socket cups.path
WantedBy=printer.target

Separate system and user daemons.
6 Advantages – Sysadmins
Modify configuration without modifying upstream configuration
Service watching (startup, watchdog, failure modes)
systemd-delta
[EXTENDED]   /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service → /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d/debian.conf
[EXTENDED]   /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service → /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf
[EQUIVALENT] /etc/systemd/system/default.target → /lib/systemd/system/default.target

3 overridden configuration files found.

7 Advantages – Programming
Removal of some error and security prone code

socket activation (e.g. privileged ports)
user/group changing

8 Advantages – Provisioning
standardized cgroup controls
containers
debootstrap ; systemd-spawn-boot
* systemd takes care of all pseudo file systems for you
9 Advantages – Users
quick to boot
can reduce load later on (services start &amp;amp; stop as required)
10 Examples
Color legend:

black = Requires
dark blue = Requisite
dark grey = Wants
red = Conflicts
green = After

systemd-analyze blame
systemd-analyze plot
systemd-analyze plot gdm.service
11 Disadvantages
Journald

It’s really nice in theory, but in practice I’ve found it to be slow and buggy

It’s a little new, so LTS distros necessarily have older versions

el7 has something like 200 patches

network-online.target is a bit flakey
DBUS

Unix is a graveyard of IPC, I don’t feel DBUS is much better
KDBUS means it will probably be around for ever.

12 Quandries
Deeply hooked into linux specific details, not portable

kernel api, cgroups, udev etc.

Some cool features relient on file system e.g. btrfs for snapshot
13 Future
I haven’t had a chance to play with networkd yet, but it sounds like it’s going to be very good.
14 Questions
Migrating

It depends…
systemd only supports start/stop/reload
work with the daemon: oneshot/simple/forking/inetd
integrate with systemd: notify, watchdog

Userspace

Every login, a separate systemd –user is spawned
Can override with .config/systemd files

    <itunes:summary><![CDATA[1 What is systemd?
A dependency system for unix services.
And, a set of basic unix services to make a unix system usable.
And, a growing list of not quite so basic services

NTP, networkd, timers (crond/atd)

From a programmers perspective, it’s the mainloop phenomenon.
2 Alternatives
Solaris: Service Management Facility
Mac OSX: launchd
Ubuntu: upstart (until recently)
3 Replaces
SYSV
LSB (actually implements LSB deps)
4 Terminology
units

[auto]mount
swap
path (inotify triggers)
socket
timer (crond/atd)
service
slice (cgroup)
pseudo
device
snapshot
scope



targets

replace run levels
default target at boot
can isolate to just one target

5 Advantages – Design
Proper, explicit dependencies between system compontents
Starts components in parallel
A proper separation of concerns, lots of situations covered.

configuration files are regular, simple to understand generally small
OTOH, there are LOTS of options

Configuration is not runnable shell.
[Unit]
Description=CUPS Scheduler
Documentation=man:cupsd(8)

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cupsd -l
Type=simple

[Install]
Also=cups.socket cups.path
WantedBy=printer.target

Separate system and user daemons.
6 Advantages – Sysadmins
Modify configuration without modifying upstream configuration
Service watching (startup, watchdog, failure modes)
systemd-delta
[EXTENDED]   /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service → /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d/debian.conf
[EXTENDED]   /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service → /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf
[EQUIVALENT] /etc/systemd/system/default.target → /lib/systemd/system/default.target

3 overridden configuration files found.

7 Advantages – Programming
Removal of some error and security prone code

socket activation (e.g. privileged ports)
user/group changing

8 Advantages – Provisioning
standardized cgroup controls
containers
debootstrap ; systemd-spawn-boot
* systemd takes care of all pseudo file systems for you
9 Advantages – Users
quick to boot
can reduce load later on (services start &amp;amp; stop as required)
10 Examples
Color legend:

black = Requires
dark blue = Requisite
dark grey = Wants
red = Conflicts
green = After

systemd-analyze blame
systemd-analyze plot
systemd-analyze plot gdm.service
11 Disadvantages
Journald

It’s really nice in theory, but in practice I’ve found it to be slow and buggy

It’s a little new, so LTS distros necessarily have older versions

el7 has something like 200 patches

network-online.target is a bit flakey
DBUS

Unix is a graveyard of IPC, I don’t feel DBUS is much better
KDBUS means it will probably be around for ever.

12 Quandries
Deeply hooked into linux specific details, not portable

kernel api, cgroups, udev etc.

Some cool features relient on file system e.g. btrfs for snapshot
13 Future
I haven’t had a chance to play with netw]]>

    <title>HPR1929: I Found a Flashlight</title>

    <description><![CDATA[I Found a Flashlight

A couple of weeks ago on the way to work I found a flashlight (or a &quot;torch,&quot; for those folks across the pond). It was rolling around on the street getting run over by cars and seemingly not suffering any damage as result. As soon as it was safe, I walked out into the street and grabbed it and took it with me. A little poking around online showed me that this was no ordinary device, but a police-grade flashlight.



I contacted the Lafayette Police Department to find out what kind of flashlights they used and whether anyone had reported one missing. Ordinarily when I find something I don't worry about this, but I discovered that this thing cost quite a lot of money—around $125 on Amazon with a retail price of $225—and if a police officer had lost it I certainly didn't want him going into his own pocket to replace it if I could just give it back to him. The police department wrote back to me saying, yes, this was the kind of flashlight that they issued to their officers but no one was missing one. I also asked the University Police and they said they don't normally issue flashlights but that sometimes officers bought their own and no one had reported missing one. 

After seeing the amazing build quality and absolutely unbelievable light quality this thing produced, I decided to keep it and so I had to buy a charger to recharge the battery. This cost about $28 and now I'm the proud owner of a Streamlight SL-20L flashlight. This is truly one of the greatest tools I've ever had. Listen to the show to hear me sing its praises!
