    <title>HPR1900: 20 - SSH Basics</title>

So as we saw in the introductory tutorial, SSH uses the Client-Server model. Now, technically a server is just the machine you are connecting to, and there is no reason in principle that it could not be another desktop, a laptop, or even a telephone if it has the appropriate software. and in the previous tutorial we showed how you can easily install and set up an ssh server on your home network using another computer or a Raspberry Pi so that you can experiment with these commands. The model really reduces to you as the client, and the other machine as the server. As with all Internet connections there are standards and protocols involved. The original Telnet communicated over TCP through port 23. Because SSH was conceived as a replacement, it used the same TCP protocols, and was assigned the adjacent port number of 22.

    <title>HPR1899: MyTinyTodo List</title>
    <author>jonlancekulp.nospam@nospam.gmail.com (Jon Kulp)</author>
    <link>http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1899</link>
    <description><![CDATA[This show is about my favorite tool to keep track of stuff I have to do, stuff I want to do, gift ideas for my family, books I want to read, HPR topics to record, etc. It's called MyTinyTodo. It's a web app that you can host on your own server and access from any device that has a web browser.
The website claims that it is already mobile friendly, but I did not like the mobile interface they had, and also did not like the fact that I had to use a different URL to get the mobile interface, so I hacked the stylesheet and the index.html file in the code to make it a responsive design. Now it looks great on all of my devices.
Features

Multiple lists
Task notes
Tags (and tag cloud)
Due dates (input format: y-m-d, m/d/y, d.m.y, m/d, d.m)
Priority (-1, 0, +1, +2)
Different sortings including sort by drag-and-drop
Search
Password protection

System requirements

PHP 5.2.0 or greater;
PHP extensions: php_mysql (MySQL version), php_pdo and php_pdo_sqlite (SQLite version).

Installation
Setup is very easy as these things go. Check out the installation instructions at their website.]]>

How I got my music library transferred from my Mac to my Linux box, thereby allowing me to fully switch to Linux. This is a problem I've been neglecting for a while that has been keeping me tethered to iTunes whenever I want to hear my music. This probably isn't the best or simplest solution, but it's how I felt comfortable doing it.

    <description><![CDATA[In this recording I describe how I decided where to store software that I downloaded manually, as opposed to software that is installed and organized automatically by GNU/Linux systems.
SPOILER: I settled on ~/local/src/ and ~/local/opt/
Happy Halloween.
This is my first time recording a podcast. I recorded this in an afternoon when no one else was around except the furry kids and the neighbors outside. I've had the idea for this episode for a while, but having never recorded before didn't really know when/where/how to do it until just now.
The perspective of this episode comes from a GNU/Linux user since Sept. 2012, and a little bit of experience from 2002-2004. I'm interested in easy, simple solutions that everyone can use to solve problems or use new things.
Special thanks to Clacke for recommending in his recent episode the free/open-source Android recording application uRecord available from F-Droid. The resulting audio sounds great and uRecord is very easy to use. I recorded several separate paragraphs and concatenated them with Audacity.

    <title>HPR1895: 65 - LibreOffice Impress - OLE Objects, Spreadsheets, and Charts</title>
    <author>zwilnik.nospam@nospam.zwilnik.com (Ahuka)</author>

    <description><![CDATA[
The next topic we want to cover involves something called OLE, which stands for Object Linking and Embedding. This was developed by Microsoft, but has spread to the free software world as well. What it means is that you can use data from two different programs together, and changes made in place are automatically reflected in the other place. A great example comes with spreadsheets, since you create them in a spreadsheet program like Calc, but you might want to take a table created there and put it into a slide to display.

    <title>HPR1894: Interview with Davide Zilli and Dr Marianne Sinka of the HumBug Project</title>

    <description><![CDATA[
Back in 2012 I put up a blog post on my site related to the need for an Open Source Mosquito Locator. Mosquitoes are the greatest killer of humans per year.



Recently Alexandre Azzalini left a comment pointing me to the HumBug project which is dedicated to Mosquito Detection and Habitat Mapping for Improved Malaria Modelling. I got in touch, and so today I talk to Davide Zilli, and Dr. Marianne Sinka who were winners of the Google Impact Challenge UK 2014.


Royal Botanic Gardens Kew: Crowdsourcing data to help prevent mosquito-borne diseases

Mosquitoes are responsible for the spread of some of the most deadly and costly diseases, with more than half the world's population living in areas where they are routinely exposed to disease carrying mosquitoes. One of the most deadly diseases that they transmit is malaria, that kills over 600,000 people every year. The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew will equip villagers in rural Indonesia with wearable acoustic sensors to detect the sound of mosquitoes. Each species has its own wing beat allowing the research team to record the occurrence of different species, as well as daily readings of critical environmental conditions. Combined with detailed vegetation maps, this will be able to track disease-bearing mosquitoes. Over the next three years, Kew Gardens will work with Oxford University to turn this project into a reality, creating a downloadable smartphone app and a range of wearable acoustic detectors. This novel technology will be trialled in 150 rural households in Indonesia with the aim of preventing and managing outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. This prototype technology has the potential ultimately to be rolled out in every region of the world where mosquito-borne diseases pose a threat to life.
https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/uk2014


Their approach is to use a Goertzel algorithm running on either a dedicated device or on a smart phone to identify species. This data will then be used for Habitat Mapping and Vector modeling to try and target only species that are a danger to Humans.

My LastPass Alternative



Password Database: KeePass http://keepass.info/
KeePass client is in the fedora repos.




Save file to a location that will be synced between devices.  Im my case Owncloud.   Desktop Client syncs available for Linux, Windows and Mac. Mobile clients for Android, IOS, and even blackberry. Syncing note:  I do not launch the desktop client on login. This allows the owncloud client to sync files before launching keepass. Also, I exit keypass before logging out for the same reason.


For integration with browser, there are



Firefox: Passifox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passifox/

Chrome: chromeIPass https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae?hl=en

Android: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=keepass&amp;amp;fdid=com.android.keepass




And finally when on machines I don't control:



Remote Access: Browser Pass https://bitbucket.org/namn/browsepass/




On same server with ownlcloud, can open files
