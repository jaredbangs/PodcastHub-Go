					<title>Windows as a Service with Mark Minasi</title>

					<description>How is Windows 10 working out for you? To finish 2015, Richard chats with Mark Minasi about the on-going changes to Windows that should result in this idea of Windows-as-a-Service. Mark talks about the almost continuous building process going on with Windows, and how various rings of folks get access to those builds. Most of those builds are only visible to Microsoft employees, but you can see them at BuildFeed - and you can get further into the new builds with the Windows Insider Program. The challenge of this new model will be the demand to keep up to date. How often and you and your organization stand new versions of Windows? Every year? Every few months?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/fyMqegTae8Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<description>Ready for SharePoint 2016? Richard chats with Todd Klindt about what's coming in SharePoint 2016, comparing the differences in on-premise and Office 365 versions. Todd talks about the dark times a couple of years ago where it seemed like SharePoint on-premise was over - it was cloud or nothing. But that has changed, today the hybrid option of some SharePoint elements in the cloud and some on-premise is possible. Want to keep your files on-premise but search in the cloud? No problem! How about just externally accessible files in the cloud? Todd talks through all these scenarios - you can do SharePoint the way you want!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/n9ttv3j_y6k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<title>Microsoft Azure Backup Services with Aidan Finn</title>

					<description>Can you use the cloud as backup? Richard chats with Aidan Finn about Microsoft Azure Backup and Site Recovery services. The conversation starts out talking about the challenges of earlier versions of Azure backup, which could really only handle files. If you wanted more comprehensive backup, you needed System Center Data Protection Manager, which was more complex (and expensive) than most SMB businesses wanted. But the latest incarnation of Azure Backup Services covers everything at a much more incremental price. And then there's Site Recovery, which can snap entire VMs from on-premise and keep them in the cloud - lots of options to protect your data and systems!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/xg-bJTu5aO0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<description>Data breaches are a fact of life - how can you resist them, and when that fails, deal with them effectively? Richard talks to Troy Hunt about his experience studying a huge variety of data breaches over the past few years. Having a plan for dealing with breaches is key, but so is actually being able to detect a breach, and knowing what to do when someone tells you that you have been breached - ignoring it won't make it go away! As far as resisting breaches, have you tried hacking your own site? There are lots of free (and paid) tools out there to show you your vulnerabilities. If you don't run them, someone else WILL!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/I4YaawXHPvA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<description>So what can go wrong with Windows 10 and what do you do about it? Richard chats with Mike Halsey about his experiences troubleshooting Windows 10. Mike talks about driver issues - standard fare for a new version of Windows, especially with the huge number of upgrades. Hardware vendors are not always diligent about getting new drivers made for old hardware, they'd much rather focus on new drivers for new hardware that they can sell. The conversation also digs into badly behaved software and how it can destabilize a system. Mike provides lots of tips and tricks for figuring out what is going on in your system and how to get it back on track.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/bBIQSqx1ryM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<description>Where is Exchange 2016 on your radar? Richard chats with Tony Redmond about the current history of Exchange, from 2003 onward. Tony talks about the growth of Exchange Online with Office 365, and the impact that has had on the shape of Exchange on-premise. This leads to a discussion about Exchange 2016 which looks to be a maturing of Exchange 2013 without really disruptive changes. One of the biggest changes in the past three years has been the improvement in updates, to the point where they are boring - but also that there are no perfect versions of software anymore, just an on-going continuum. Lots of digressions, but also great thinking about modern on-premise and in-cloud mail!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/AV3IiQhQlgM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<title>Getting Ready for Nano Server with Jason Helmick</title>
					<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RunasRadio/~3/zxW5GgxcKdA/default.aspx</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Are you thinking about Microsoft Nano Server yet? Richard chats with Jason Helmick about what we can do today to get ready for Nano Server. As announced by freshly minted Tech Fellow Jeffrey Snover, Nano Server represents an ultra-light version of Windows Server and the new foundation of the server side of the operating system. So what can you do to get ready? Jason talks about working with the Core edition of Windows Server, preferably 2012, as a great starting point. This gets you started on a path of using PowerShell and scripting to configure and operate your servers, rather than GUIs and RDP. The conversation then turns to Desired State Configuration as the ultimate goal - getting every aspect of a server described in code so that you can create it, consistently, on demand.

					<itunes:summary>Are you thinking about Microsoft Nano Server yet? Richard chats with Jason Helmick about what we can do today to get ready for Nano Server. As announced by freshly minted Tech Fellow Jeffrey Snover, Nano Server represents an ultra-light version of Windows Server and the new foundation of the server side of the operating system. So what can you do to get ready? Jason talks about working with the Core edition of Windows Server, preferably 2012, as a great starting point. This gets you started on a path of using PowerShell and scripting to configure and operate your servers, rather than GUIs and RDP. The conversation then turns to Desired State Configuration as the ultimate goal - getting every aspect of a server described in code so that you can create it, consistently, on demand.

					<title>vSphere and Hyper-V with Greg Shields</title>

					<pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Does it matter what virtualization technology you use? Richard chats with Greg Shields, one of the few folks out there with certifications in Microsoft's Hyper-V, VMWare's vSphere and Citrix Xen about the relatively merits of the stacks. Turns out, they're pretty close together, at least when it comes to virtualization. But the conversation goes deeper into the instrumentation - how do you know that you have the right loads on the right hardware? Can you make your own cloud effectively - it's got more to do with architecture than operating systems, as it turns out. Greg focuses in on the way you understand your systems as the true differentiator today!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunasRadio/~4/BZdPITbmaig" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					<description>There are lots of reasons to instrument your apps in production - but one of the most powerful is to understand how your users actually *use* your apps. Richard talks to Andreas Grabner of DynaTrace about the variety of instrumentation approaches possible for applications - some driven by operations, and some by development. But everyone in the organization can benefit from a deeper understanding of how applications are used. Andreas talks about the diversity of metrics that can be taken, from your typical ecommerce financial metrics, to performance metrics, to reliability and scalability.

After some history discussion about how Windows 10 came to be, from Vista on up, Paul digs into the truth of the matter - Windows 10 isn't quite done yet, it's fine for consumers, but IT Pros need to look carefully. It's a powerful operating system that alongside the upcoming Server 2016 should be able to take infrastructure to the next level, which Paul says is hybrid cloud.
