			<title>Big wheel keep on turning!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just did another transition of the Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been doing this at least once a year for the last 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time flies when you're having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're reading this blog in an RSS reader, this feed has been quiet for the last few weeks while I've been getting ready for the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will notice that there are a lot of new items in the feed right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will settle down, again, once the transition is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any trouble with the new feed, please post a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/11/13/newFlowForScriptingNews.html&quot;&gt;comment here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they say..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Re Donald Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way I look at it is we'll be dead pretty soon either way. And then if we have any existence at all, time will stretch out into billions of years, and over that period of time, our little world is doomed no matter what. If it happens five years after I'm dead or 5 millions, it makes no difference to me. The day is coming, whether or not Donald Trump is an opportunistic asshole, which he certainly is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A tale of WebSockets and JavaScript</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a problem with the liveblog that was solved by WebSockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I was using longpolling to handle updates. Basically each time you load Scripting News, it connects with the 1999.io server with a request that doesn't return until there's an update to the content on Scripting News, or it times out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did it this way because I had lots of experience with longpolling, and had code that worked. But it had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had two tabs open in Chrome and both were waiting for a longpoll to return from the same server, the browser would get confused and only one would get the response. So to get the update you'd have to reload the page. Which defeats the purpose of having a live connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wondered if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; would work better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I implemented WebSockets support on the server, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-websocket&quot;&gt;nodejs-websocket&lt;/a&gt; package, and hooked up a test app to the server, and launched three instances in separate tabs in a single Chrome window. And I held my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked! I suspected the browser guys might have tested this case, and the bet paid off. So I adapted the Scripting News home page app to use WebSockets, and all is good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I celebrated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/664941681591132160&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; last night when I got this working. &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they say..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>News orgs have become app devs (and that's not good)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't think the news orgs realize that they are now, to Facebook and Apple, developers. This relationship, therefore, isn't new for the tech industry. There's lots of prior art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes platform vendors need developers because they need apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they don't need any individual developer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned after many years trying to be a developer for corporate platforms is that people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the news people think they have any leverage over the platform vendors, I suspect they will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only hope they have is to own their distribution system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I still don't think it's too late. But it is later. And eventually it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be too late.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: To be clear,&amp;nbsp;I don't mean that the are literally app developers, I mean they play the role of app developers in the news ecosystem as configured by Facebook and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Daniel Murphy, take the deal</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Murphy should accept the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-tied-hear-back-daniel-murphy-article-1.2433068&quot;&gt;Mets offer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a lot like JR Smith turning down the option on the third year of his contract. He over-estimated how much value the rest of the NBA gave him. He was lucky to have a guarantee from a team like Cleveland. He needs a strong leader like LBJ to keep him from fucking up. In a similar way, Murphy shines in NY in a way he won't shine anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belongs here. It's a great offer. Take it, and kick back. You can live your whole life, in great style, on that one paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kristaps, local news, fans, bloggers and rivers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;File this under mainstream news orgs and rivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every local news org should have a river for each of their major sports teams. This would encourage local fans to start blogs, and would give reporters a whole other dimension to report on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now when they talk about fans they'll have some actual fans in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd esp like to follow a Knicks river from the Post, NYDN or NYT because the story is quickly becoming how did we get so lucky with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/11/5-reasons-kristpas-porzingis-is-becoming-the-nbas-next-big-thing?utm_source=feedblitz&amp;amp;utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usatodaycomnba-topstories&quot;&gt;Kristaps Porzingas&lt;/a&gt;. He's a 7'3&quot; player who owns the inside and can make a long &lt;a href=&quot;https://vine.co/v/el0WAJjqpKb&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; at the buzzer from way downtown. He's amazing.

He's a 7'3&quot; player who owns the inside and can make a long &lt;a href=&quot;https://vine.co/v/el0WAJjqpKb&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; at the buzzer from way downtown. He's amazing.

			<title>To Bill Gurley re the Knicks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last night I was switching back and forth between the Republican debate and the Knicks game vs the Toronto Raptors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Knicks were playing well. And a funny thing was happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other guys were respecting the hell out of Kristaps Porzingas, and that meant some of the pressure was off Melo. The Knicks have needed this for a long time. So the game was interesting, and in very uncharacteristic fashion the Knicks won in a squeaker at the end. Last year they would have lost this game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vine.co/v/elDHOgZwqxz&quot;&gt;highlight&lt;/a&gt; of Porzingas being an animal, rushing through the defense to put back a missed Knicks shot. The best part was Clyde's reaction. With glee, he said &quot;that was nasty!&quot; It was. You can tell he loves Porzingas. That's a good sign because Clyde is in many ways the heart of the Knicks, at least for the fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knicks fans suffer. We have most inept ownership in the NBA. And we have a star who's a bit of a baby, who might be growing up, a little. And because it's basically the only NYC team, and it's such a big place, we have all kinds of fans. It's a team that both Mets and Yankees fans share. And we know that Mets fans do not like Yankees fans, and vice versa (although it's hard to know why they don't like us, we're such nice people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankees fans feel it is their right to win every season, and they do it by spending the most money on the best players. Mets fans, well we do it differently, let's just say.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bgurley&quot;&gt;Bill Gurley&lt;/a&gt; who is according to his Twitter profile a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/659222506864177152&quot;&gt;devoted&lt;/a&gt; Golden State Warriors fan, the current NBA champs, apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/664331506299461632&quot;&gt;thinks&lt;/a&gt; all Knicks fans booed when the team drafted Porzingas earlier this year. I don't think that's the case at all. I know quite a few Knicks fans, and some of them even are Yankees fans, and I don't think any of us booed. We might have wondered where this guy came from (Latvia) and why Phil Jackson chose him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, we haven't been all that impressed with Jackson and his Triangle Offense. Last year we had the second worst record in the NBA. That's something because more than a few teams were deliberately tanking. But this year, with the exception of Melo, we're looking at a team that was built totally by Jackson. And it's not bad. We're hopeful. Might see some good basketball this year at the Garden. And for this Knicks fan, that's enough. Really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Bill, it's not consistent with my philosophy, or the Knicks philosophy, to boo our team. Sure there are some assholes who do. Don't forget Silicon Valley has Larry Ellison &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a bunch of nice guys. This is New York, the largest city in the United States. A melting pot. And you don't have to be a true fan to wear a Knicks jersey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So please, love your Warriors, we sure are impressed with them! But please don't question our loyalty to our team. That's just not cool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>More intellect please</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voxer.com/&quot;&gt;Voxing&lt;/a&gt; with NakedJen about this, and thought I should put something here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I have crossed a line, I'm totally over the big networks and wide communication. Most of it is spam. People hungry for attention, and willing to say garbage to get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's almost no quality to my experience on Twitter and Facebook these days. And in the last few days, with all the crazyness about Halloween costumes and Starbucks cups, finally pushed me over the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need less reach, more intellect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A beautiful-no-ugly hack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn't get Twitter to accept a PNG with a transparent background. I read that the Android client could do it, so I tried it there too and on my iPhone, and in every case the transparent part of the image would turn to white.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figured out how to get what I want anyway. I just created a page with the transparent image on the color background I want it look good on, then did a small screen capture, pasted it into the Mac Preview app, saved it and uploaded to Twitter, and it worked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a hack, hopefully temporary, but now I was able to get rid of the unsightly white splotches on my otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36518280/misc/clarusOnWhiteSmokeOn1999.png&quot;&gt;beautiful&lt;/a&gt; editor. &lt;img title='wink' alt='wink' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What is free-speech-safe?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used a term in a tweet that I haven't defined -- &lt;i&gt;free-speech-safe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The term applies to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;writing/publishing environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question becomes important as the tech industry sucks the open web into silos. This has been going on for years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can publish on my own site, as I'm doing here. However, because the site uses Amazon storage, it exists here only as long as Amazon is willing to let it be here. Their record is not perfect. But it's better than posting on Facebook. Therefore it might not be possible to create an absolutely free-speech-safe environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I posted a link to a Boing Boing article to Facebook and it rejected the post. I assume it's because the BB piece pointed to a site that they don't want people pointing to. I said that in the most neutral way possible. I haven't been told by Facebook why it wouldn't let me point to it. I have asked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=392164227657655&amp;amp;set=a.113966572144090.1073741828.100005922431565&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not free-speech safe, and not just because of this. They won't allow pictures of naked human bodies. They won't let people use their chosen names. There are so many things Facebook won't allow. Don't assume you're getting the whole story on Facebook. You are not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't think you can publish journalism on Facebook with all the rules about what they will and will not allow. Yet journalistic organizations are publishing there. I understand why they're doing it, to reach readers. I would do it too. But we still need places where people can be totally free to speak. I believe Facebook people would want to read such a site too. They're not bad people, they're just not creating a place where free speech is tolerated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've yet to create a really free-speech-safe environment for writing on the web. I think we could do a lot better than we have done, if we had the will to do it. So far it's pretty clear we don't have that will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They won't allow pictures of naked human bodies. They won't let people use their chosen names. There are so many things Facebook won't allow. Don't assume you're getting the whole story on Facebook. You are not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't think you can publish journalism on Facebook with all the rules about what they will and will not allow. Yet journalistic organizations are publishing there. I understand why they're doing it, to reach readers. I would do it too. But we still need places where people can be totally free to speak. I believe Facebook people would want to read such a site too. They're not bad people, they're just not creating a place where free speech is tolerated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've yet to create a really free-speech-safe environment for writing on the web. I think we could do a lot better than we have done, if we had the will to do it. So far it's pretty clear we don't have that will.&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Mon, 09 Nov 2015 20:06:41 GMT" >

			<title>Is another war in Iraq in our future?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/544893/bush-41s-attack-on-his-sons-war-in-iraq-heralds-the-end-of-the-bush-dynasty/&quot;&gt;Quartz piece&lt;/a&gt; about the Bushes and how they have gone to war in Iraq and wondered if the leading Republican is elected, either one, will they start another war in Iraq. The scary thing is this: How could you possible guess one way or another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With HRC, I can't imagine we would. We're even more war-averse now than we were after Vietnam, at least I hope we are. But then there is a lot of lunacy to the US these days. More than usual.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that might have something to do with why the military is paying to put on little military plays at sporting events. To make sure the militaristic spirit of 9/11 is alive. That, I imagine, will continue no matter who is elected President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I fully understand what's happening in the US now. The super-rich of the world are looting us. They want to keep the population quiet and distracted until it's done. Once it's finished, they'll leave us with our guns to kill each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One quick way to loot the treasury is to keep us at a perpetual state of war. In wars no one counts their change too carefully.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it's not one of my most positive images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Poke to Fox News -- remember Benghazi?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was bored last night and watched a bit of Fox News because there was nothing else on but NFL which I find even more boring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had a panel of Repub and Dem consultants who all agreed that the media is in the bag for the Dems and would never scrutinize the Democratic front-runner the way they do the Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to call in a question, if they took such questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about Hillary Clinton and her emails? And Benghazi? And whatever else they like to rant on about her. I guess that doesn't count? I also seem to remember something about Obama &quot;palling around with terrorists&quot; and the whole Swift Boat thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>The Mets ran out of gas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was emailing with my old friend from Mac days, David Jacobs, about this year's playoffs. Dave is a Cubs fan. I am, as you know, a Mets fan. The Mets and the Cubs have never played in the post-season before this year. Dave and I have been to a lot of Bay Area baseball games together, but of course never with the Cubs playing the Mets. So this time our friendship was tested, in a very unusual way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the way it turned out, I waited a few days after the Mets loss in the World Series to contact Dave, and was careful not to make it about baseball. I sent him a link to Zach Seward's &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/536410/review-of-streaming-media-players/&quot;&gt;comparative review&lt;/a&gt; of new TV from tech companies. Dave was the original Fetish columnist at Wired, at the same time I was a columnist at HotWired. Neither of us were journalists, before or since. Anyway, I told Dave that Zach, a young man who I've known about ten years, was picking up the baton in a nice way. I sent a link to his piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then of course we discussed the post-season. Dave said the Mets weren't managed well in the World Series. I had a different theory. Here's what I wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The Mets ran out of gas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly the way they were playing in Sept after clinching, I was surprised they beat the Dodgers, and by the time we got to the NLCS it was a juggernaut. But you could see the certainty creep in, and that was the mistake. I think some of the Mets thought they were the Yankees!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the most exciting baseball for me, ever. When the Mets won in 1969 we had nothing like the Internet, and I couldn't afford to go to any of the postseason games, and I had to go to school!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in 1986 I was totally preoccupied with Living Videotext, got to watch the games, but didn't get to experience it like this year. 2000 was like a dream. I don't know what I was doing then.  But this year. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a thrill. And I'm totally ready for next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mets have never been about winning. I'm sure you understand that, being a Cubs fan. We have that in common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why when the team actually does win it's so fucking amazing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you should be totally proud of the Cubs. I loved the way they do it at Wrigley Field. It's so commercial everywhere else. They'll be great next year too. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;That seems a good place to leave it until next year. Which Cubs and Mets always understand is where greatness lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>GamerGate is a touchy subject</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisweekinstartups.com/miles-beckett-silversheet/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+twist-audio+%28This+Week+in+Startups+-+Audio%29&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; This Week in Startups podcast. It's one of the podcasts in the rotation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show began this week with a touchy question -- What is GamerGate? Basically most people don't want to say what it is probably because they don't want to be part of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;They also mentioned a product that helps you manage leads. I think I've been getting email through one of those services. I've noticed an uptick in &quot;personal&quot; messages from companies I've never heard of, from people who talk as if they know me. I suspect they're actually fictional people now that I've heard about this service. I guess it had to come to this eventually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Calacanis talks like Quentin Tarantino. I wonder if they come from the same neighborhood in Brooklyn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Facebook has an ark for news, and you and I aren't on it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is starting a new distribution &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/4/9670600/facebook-notify-real-time-news-notifications-app-launch&quot;&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; next week, an app that carries news content, and unless you're one of the big media companies they invited to be part of it, you don't get to put stories into that pipe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows how it will go. Sometimes big companies make moves like this and they go nowhere. They start something new and proprietary to replace something open to all, and the open platform proves overwhelming, and nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I have a feeling this is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had an idea that I wanted to get out there. Not uncommon, my blog is filled with them, but this one I put in full text on Facebook and on my blog. It had relatively big impact in the Facebook version. Not many people read it on my blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even that's not going to be good enough starting next week because there will be a second more elite tier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;So I've come to the conclusion, that most of you must come to as well, that unless Facebook decides to let me in, I have to make people come read me on my site. At least the big publishers get to make a choice. You and I have not even been offered the choice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if they do let me in, I'm going.

				<source:outline text="&lt;p&gt;Facebook is starting a new distribution &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/4/9670600/facebook-notify-real-time-news-notifications-app-launch&quot;&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; next week, an app that carries news content, and unless you're one of the big media companies they invited to be part of it, you don't get to put stories into that pipe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows how it will go. Sometimes big companies make moves like this and they go nowhere. They start something new and proprietary to replace something open to all, and the open platform proves overwhelming, and nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I have a feeling this is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had an idea that I wanted to get out there. Not uncommon, my blog is filled with them, but this one I put in full text on Facebook and on my blog. It had relatively big impact in the Facebook version. Not many people read it on my blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even that's not going to be good enough starting next week because there will be a second more elite tier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;So I've come to the conclusion, that most of you must come to as well, that unless Facebook decides to let me in, I have to make people come read me on my site. At least the big publishers get to make a choice. You and I have not even been offered the choice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if they do let me in, I'm going. I'm not taking one for the team. Done it too many times and learned I'm always the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say they plan to open it up, but we know that plans can change.

			<title>Fargo the TV show</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just rewatched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)#Season_1&quot;&gt;season 1&lt;/a&gt; of Fargo. It was good to get all that fresh in my mind, getting ready to start season 2. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an incredible show, as good as the movie, but different in creative ways. Many of the major elements in the movie show up in the show but with different characters at different times, it's a different story, but in some ways not really.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both shows have a smart woman deputy and a comic bad guy, and lots and lots of colorful supporting characters and at least two or three good twists every episode. They really have a sense of timing, I forgot how good it was.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'd swear it was written by the Coen Brothers, but it's not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has a sense of humor oh man the jokes are incredible! &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tvguide.com/news/fargo-finale-noah-hawley-1083116/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the show runner about the season finale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What comes after staring into your cellphone?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Walking around the city of course you see lots of people with their eyes glued to their cell phone. The other day I decided to count as we walked through the East Village. About half the people whose paths we crossed were staring into the phones as they walked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I wondered what comes next. And I got the answer, I think, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/donlbe/posts/10104743192990033?comment_id=10104743307266023&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;total_comments=5&amp;amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. People will call Uber to transport them a few city blocks, so they can devote their full attention to whatever it is that is so captivating in their phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope people are studying this, because this is a huge transformation on a societal level. No joke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A film festival with NakedJen in NY</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NakedJen was in town, and of course as always we went to a bunch of movies. Two of them were pretty awful, and both of them were NYT critics choice movies. The other movie, Our Brand is Chaos, got a shitty review from the Times, and it deserved it, but it was actually a really fun movie. I'll try to explain the paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_(2015_film)&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;, starring Robert Redford as Dan Rather and Cate Blanchett as 60 Minutes producer Mary Mapes started with a great story, how Rather and Mapes lost their jobs at CBS News for reporting a true story with some questionable documents. They really lost to Republican bloggers. I remember at the time being split, I was very much against Bush for President, and hated the way they were campaigning against Kerry, who I voted for, but I also didn't like the way the established news media dismissed the bloggers, and refused to get in the online discussion. I think in the end this is why they lost. They failed to mobilize their friends in the blogosphere. Yes it's partisan. That's life. But the movie really dumbed the whole thing down, which is my problem with the other highly-reviewed movie. We watched Redford be Redford talking a little like Rather, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/3285.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; wasn't engaging. It was a good story, but the story-telling wasn't good. No suspension of disbelief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Spies_(film)&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Bridge of Spies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt; was another all-star production, directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks, and written by the Coen Brothers (!). But it was also a dumbed-down straight-line movie that didn't engage. Later Jen and I watched the first couple of episodes of Season 1 of the FX show Fargo, that was just inspired by the Coens, not written by them, and it was a perfect illustration of what was missing in Bridge and in Truth -- anything interesting for the viewer with a mind. This might be a good movie for kids, about what the Cold War was like in the US and in Berlin (assuming it was accurate about Berlin). That and a few interesting lines here and there was all the entertainment this movie had to offer. How the Coen Brothers participated is a mystery. I can't imagine why they let them put their name on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Brand_Is_Crisis_(2015_film)&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Our Brand is Crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt; is non-stop Sandra Bullock, who we love, and will always command our attention. Sure there was a gaping huge flaw in the movie that the Times pointed out, and for that it deserves a bad review, but if they would have chopped off the last 10 minutes of the movie it would have stood up fine as a tale of American pollution of the global political process. Billy Bob Thornton and Bullock have a fantastic relationship of nasty tricks, back and forth, and some wild scenes, not all of which make total sense, but who cares since Bullock is so captivating! Lovely movie and entertaining, and a very interesting contrast to the other two.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;We also watched a DVD movie &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_(2015_film)&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;, which we both recommend. You can't really write about it without spoiling it. It's suspenseful and has a thriller element to it, but that's not the actual story. I loved this movie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder why Twitter didn't leapfrog Facebook and offer an array of different &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt;-like emoji.

			<title>Lost in NY</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I got lost on the Italian train system going from Milan to Trieste, and was helped by a bunch of different Italians none of whom spoke any English and of course I didn't speak Italian. I wondered if my country would be so concerned about the welfare of a foreigner and helpful, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/nyregion/missing-italian-marathoner-found-on-new-york-subway-still-in-his-running-gear.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;module=second-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;amp;_r=1&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; told me, thankfully that we are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<source:outline text="&lt;p&gt;Last year I got lost on the Italian train system going from Milan to Trieste, and was helped by a bunch of different Italians none of whom spoke any English and of course I didn't speak Italian. I wondered if my country would be so concerned about the welfare of a foreigner and helpful, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/nyregion/missing-italian-marathoner-found-on-new-york-subway-still-in-his-running-gear.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;module=second-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;amp;_r=1&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; told me, thankfully that we are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Wed, 04 Nov 2015 14:09:53 GMT" />

			<title>Apple Watch goes AWOL</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden my iPhone can't find my Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I go to the Bluetooth panel of Settings on the iPhone it says it's not connected. When I try to connected it says it couldn't find it and I should make sure it's turned on and nearby. It's on my wrist, fully charged, and turned on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any clues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course as soon as I posted this, the two devices found each other and are making happy. It always seems to work that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>The red heart for Like is a problem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A problem with the rebranding of Favorite as Like are all the historical favorites we've created, and the symbol that Twitter has chosen for Like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, there is no Heart for liking. They use a thumb-up. A lot of thought must have gone into this. We like things we don't actually like, and shrug off the confusion. But labeling it with a red heart pushes it further.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: You may have Favorited something about a terrorist group, but would you have clicked on a red heart? At the very least that's going to take some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Don't cry for Mets fans!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mets had an unexpected great post-season.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were long-shots against both the Dodgers and the Cubs. I don't think the Royals were better than the Mets, but they &lt;i&gt;played&lt;/i&gt; better. Much better. Our hitters stopped hitting, and the fielders stopped fielding. We never really were that great at hitting or fielding. So next year, I think there will be a lot of changes in everything but pitching and the outfield. The infield will look quite different, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were exceptions, Granderson was a steady hitter, and Flores was a dependable shortstop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright, while he leads the team spiritually is playing injured, and Murphy is a liability we clearly can't afford. We need a solid defensive second baseman. Maybe that will be Flores when Tejada comes back next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We clearly stay with Conforto and Legares. We might have to say goodbye to Duda at first, who could become a bench hitter, or be traded to an American League team as a DH.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year all the National League teams will be gunning for our Mets. It will be a very competitive and interesting year, but there will also be lots of love, because that's what we do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somewhat suspect that Cespedes and/or Murphy will end up on one of the teams the Mets play in the postseason next year. That'll be interesting! &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Taking a little break for RSI</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm taking a little break from blogging and software-writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right wrist needs a break from non-stop typing every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been very good for the wrist. At first it hurt more, I think that's because the numbness was subsiding, and after a night's sleep it feels so much better I almost forgot the pain. That's a good sign!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been dealing with this for thirty years, on and off. Basically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury&quot;&gt;RSI&lt;/a&gt; is a bitch. But it's hardly the worst thing in the world. And we're having glorious spring-like weather in NYC right now, so there's that. &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Twitter says &quot;Favorite&quot; is now &quot;Like&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's so interesting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hearts-on-twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter is changing&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Favorite&quot; to &quot;Like&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the gravitational pull of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much as Twitter and Google Reader exerted tremendous pull on blogs Facebook is pulling Twitter. &amp;nbsp;And it's the right move for Twitter. Holding on to non-interoperable terminology is just putting off the inevitable. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been here before, many times myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullets...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Can the removal of the 140-char limit be far behind? Look at this blog post by Twitter friend Chris Sacca, in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sacca/status/661585677495230465&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;, as an image.

Haven't seen much evidence of it in my timeline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;An analogy -- when the term &quot;blog&quot; was catching on, we were calling them weblogs.

			<title>We believe, we're Mets fans</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing to say about last night's game other than this -- the Mets lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with Game 1, we were within reach of a win, and then made mistakes. Last nights' were worse. I'm not going to list them, read today's stories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlbriver.com/&quot;&gt;mlbriver.com&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure the sports columnists will catalog them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's going to be hard to come out of this. But we will, one way or another. There's always the spirit of Mookie. And Yogi. It ain't over till it's over, they both taught us. And Tug McGraw's You Gotta Believe. That's what Mets fans do, we believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And the Knicks had won their first game in a blowout. Everyone was saying &lt;i&gt;This is not last year's Knicks.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One quarter was all I could take. After all the glory of the Mets, it's so hard to go back to the Knicks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>The hopelessness of the Knicks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For people unfamiliar with NY sports, it must seem like we're all Yankees fans, but we're not. Each of our teams appeal to different flaws of NYC human nature. The Mets appeal to the believers. I'm not going to say what the Yankees appeal to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks are all about losing in ever-more-hopeless ways. It would be one thing if there was a future in our future. But there isn't. This is a team that trades away top draft picks in return for big-contract failures, who stay on the payroll long after they are gone. Maybe that part is over now with the new regime. But we're still paying for the lunacy of the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Anyway the Knicks are hopeless and not fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The only things the Knicks really have going for them are: 1. The Garden. 2. Clyde. That's about it. And the memory of a long-ago team that exuded confidence, competence, even scholarship. The Knicks did at one point deserve New York, but that was a long long time ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of TNT, I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/3288.html&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; with Shaq at the NYPL. He is so smart and funny and positive but absolutely none of that came out in the interview because person conducting the interview apparently had no idea who he was or what he did. I wonder how people who don't know Shaq react to his size. He's a sweet funny guy who wrote a children's book..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Professional software reviewers are a vestige of a long-gone distribution system</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago software was a retail business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'd create a box and put disks, a book, coupons in it and ship it off to distributors. They in turn would send it to retailers. Then we would run ads in monthly computer magazines that would get people to visit the retailer and hopefully buy the product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step in the process involved selling, and decisions made by the buyers as to how successful the product was going to be, initially, thus determining how much they wanted to have on hand for the first few weeks of the product's life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was called the pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took time for product to go into the pipeline and show up on dealer's shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you had to try to build demand for the product before it shipped. &lt;i&gt;Long&lt;/i&gt; before it shipped. Which meant going on a press tour and then starting to run ads. Ads that were wasted mostly, because the users couldn't actually buy the product yet. The ads were there to impress the reviewers and the buyers in the distribution chain, to show them how we planned to create pull for the product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant you had to show the product to reviewers long before it was ready. The &quot;manufacturing&quot; process for software was mostly intellectual. It took just a few weeks to actually print the books, duplicate the disks and put it all together and ship to the distributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was inefficient and the system and was eventually scrapped. I doubt if there are any shrinkwrap software distributors today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point: The need to show the software to reviewers before release is gone too. When you read a review of a book or a game or utility, you should be able to go get it right then. And no need to give exclusive to reviewers who are paid to do the reviews. They aren't more authoritative these days, users are clued into their conflicts, and wait to find out what other users think of the product. Bloggers are more likely to influence sales than the big name reviewers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that might shift over the years, as software review becomes as serious an activity as say film or TV shows. But you can only really have a useful opinion about software from using it for a period of time. Not like a movie very much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still have a bunch of evolving to do here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Open advice to Twitter re news...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Some free advice for Twitter re news..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;I would pick up news by a different thread.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;You have an advantage that almost every newsmaker makes news via Twitter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;So when a story is happening, the principals of the story are probably speaking on Twitter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'd look for what they're saying and present it in an easy way to skim.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The people are what's key to Twitter, stories, then people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also we saw our first Twitter TV ad last night. It's good to see Twitter doing that, but the ads are more confusing than the product. Not good for a product that normal people have trouble figuring out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better approach: It could be like the famous Apple commercial about the Crazy Ones, except you don't have to guess about who they are (Jim Henson probably didn't use a Mac, nor did Einstein or Picasso). Your icons are real people alive now, making news, if not history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Report from your brain surgeon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I found an obvious mistake and fixed it. Still quite impressed with how much works after such radical brain surgery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think perhaps I was overly cautious. Oh well. Worse things can happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the latest fix, apparently I can edit this item.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Be prepared for the tech bubble burst</title>

It's one of the basic laws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure some things gain escape velocity. Unless there's a total financial collapse people will continue to use mobile devices with screens and virtual keyboards. And there will be big leaps forward. But it might not be such a terrible thing if computer technology became more ordinary and mundane. At the scale we're operating now it might be unavoidable. Whole civilizations don't turn that quickly, even in superheated times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The point? Prepare for it. Put some new ideas in the pipe. Even ones that go against what you think is the way the world will always work. I've seen Silicon Valley ignore the next thing after the bubble crash, only to deepen the depression, and delay the recovery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Boy Scouts: Be Prepared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>I want a realtime baseball scoreboard on the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish there were a web page for MLB that had all the readouts of the scoreboards at a baseball stadium, arrayed so I could quickly glance to look at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The batting orders of both teams with a red dot next to the guy who's at bat (offense) and the guy who's up next (defense).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;A little box with the current pitcher, how many pitches thrown, strikeouts, walks, hits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;In the middle the stats on the current batter. His picture. Really big type.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;At the bottom the box score, inning by inning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;Look around the ballpark for other stats that are given permanent space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;The key thing is this is fixed, realtime, it's a page I'd put on my iPad and keep in my lap while watching the game. I'd even bring it to the game with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;And go ahead and put some ads on the page. Beer, car dealers, whatever you like. Ads and baseball go together. But nothing creepy. No lung cancer meds plese.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Flattering rich people for fun and profit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Twitter I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/658679934848802816&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how flattering rich people in writing can be very profitable. An example of that is Walter Isaacson's book about Steve Jobs. He convinced Steve to let him be his official biographer. But Isaacson is a technology neophyte. Steve was not. But the book is typical tech bio writing, basically junk, having nothing to do with the way we develop stuff. Yet it should be about that. Because all of Jobs's accomplishments, the things that make him worth writing about at all, were software development projects. But you can't do that if you're Isaacson, and it seems that Jobs should have known that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was one of Jobs's weaknesses. He was into how things looked more than how they are. He was imho a Disneyfier. Nothing wrong with that, but it can bite you in the butt. I'm sure Jobs would have hated the Isaacson book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with the Aaron Sorkin movie that was loosely based on the book. Again, has absolutely nothing to do with anything that made Jobs an interesting character. Now you might say since most people have no idea how technology works, why should anyone care. Well, in the future that might not be true. And Jobs is a historic figure. So anything that purports to be a history should somehow be connected to who the person really was. The future, imho, will need a better book about Jobs than has been written (and I include the Schlender book too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need writers who also understand tech, in other words. Not people who write words that flatter rich people. That is if we want to learn and be entertained. &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The future, imho, will need a better book about Jobs than has been written (and I include the Schlender book too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need writers who also understand tech, in other words. Not people who write words that flatter rich people. That is if we want to learn and be entertained. &lt;img title=&quot;wink&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; src=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Mon, 26 Oct 2015 16:42:33 GMT" >

			<title>How coding is like climbing Everest</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I backed out of the brain surgery project. It happens sometimes. I got too deep into it, and realized &quot;this will never work.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to take a step back and come up with a new approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>On a roll</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An old friend from Living Videotext says I'm on a roll. Can't point to his tweet because it's private.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way he's right. And in another it just looks that way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been building in JavaScript, retooling, for three years. And I've gotten to the point where so much of the stuff I had working in Frontier now works here, that I can move very quickly. Which means that when I get an idea I can have it running quickly, and while the idea is fresh, I get to work on the next one and the one after that. I call this a &quot;head of steam.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murphy-willing I'll be able to get to the next level soon, and even more stuff will be working.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What is an independent developer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently the term &quot;independent developer&quot; is not universally understood. That's a sign of the times I guess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a stab at a definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software development does not have to be a corporate thing. Sometimes software is created by individuals working with one or two other people, or on their own. Software development can be an art, like writing or sculpture. Lots of the software you use was created this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the way the personal computer software market got started. With individuals creating products, bringing them to market, selling them in some fashion, maybe starting companies around it, maybe not. Depending on how successful they are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also how the web developer world got started. Tim Berners-Lee did the initial work on the web as an indie. &amp;nbsp;And independent developers are the backbone of the game industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not talking about contractors, consultants, part-time employees. that's a completely different thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am an independent developer. Have been most of my career. Lots of other people are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/10/23/0167.html&quot;&gt;incentives for independent developers&lt;/a&gt;, these are the people I'm talking about. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why would a blogger want to be &quot;paired&quot; with a brand? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I wrote at Wired they had a party where editorial people such as myself were introduced to advertisers. It gave me the willies. What was supposed to happen here? Was I supposed to all of a sudden like your PC clone? Just because you pay to run an ad in Wired? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't like the whole idea of Medium, it's not providing a service we actually need. When you put your writing in there now in addition to questioning your motives re flow, now do we have to wonder how the pay you're getting from your paired brand is affecting what you say and don't say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I saw an employee of Amazon say, on Facebook, that a TV series on Amazon that I thought was horribly mediocre was great. I didn't feel it was appropriate for me to say what I thought of the series. The guy is just earning his paycheck I thought. But I thought less of him, esp since his job has nothing to do with Amazon's TV efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>But we like the Red Sox!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a Red Sox fan in the lobby of my building today. When he saw my Mets hat he wanted to bet me. I said that's a bet I'll take, but I'll have to give you odds I said because your team had already been eliminated. &quot;Lost to the Yankees, I believe. And the Torontos.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said I should enjoy the feeling because the Mets are going down. He said that with some glee. I thought wow he really doesn't like the Mets. I said man, we like the Red Sox, but then I guess I understand why they don't like the Mets so much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you can't win em all. But they have won a World Series more recently than we have. So come on what's the problem.

			<title>Incentives for developers?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's very generous of Jack Dorsey to create an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-23/jack-dorsey-gives-a-third-of-his-twitter-stock-back-to-employees&quot;&gt;options pool&lt;/a&gt; for Twitter employees from his own stock. I've been a CEO, and there were times when I couldn't get the board to do something I wanted, but granting options for employees was never one of them. You want to incentivize them with stock. All shareholders benefit. It doesn't seem right if one of them, even if it's the CEO, has to provide the incentive that all will benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, why employees? Tech companies always do that, but they can get a better deal from independent developers. What if Jack put 1/10th of one percent of his Twitter shares in a pool, and come up with a way to make grants to developers that are parallel to the ones made to employees. Even if the people are equally smart, the developers can act more quickly, and since they don't get salary, they're incentivized to. Nothing like having your livelihood on the line to get your thought process sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the years I've been an independent developer, I've wondered why no creative tech entrepreneur has even tried to do an incentive deal with developers. It might be too late for Twitter, probably is, but &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; should be thinking about this. So much money is sloshing around in the Valley now, creativity with that money might pay off. Something to consider.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I put my money behind my ideas this week, and bought 1000 shares of TWTR. What finally got me to move (I had been thinking about it) was Ballmer's support. He's right. They have a valuable asset. Maybe they'll figure out how to make it grow and make lots of money. But I would not mind getting some options too, since I am investing as a developer (I wonder if anyone there has noticed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: Not everyone understands what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/10/25/0185.html&quot;&gt;independent developer&lt;/a&gt; means, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What finally got me to move (I had been thinking about it) was Ballmer's support. He's right. They have a valuable asset. Maybe they'll figure out how to make it grow and make lots of money. But I would not mind getting some options too, since I am investing as a developer (I wonder if anyone there has noticed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: Not everyone understands what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/10/25/0185.html&quot;&gt;independent developer&lt;/a&gt; means, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Fri, 23 Oct 2015 16:10:18 GMT" />

			<title>Baseball philosophy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://busblog.tonypierce.com/2015/10/the-latest-obsession-with-the-cubs-winning-isnt-good.html&quot;&gt;incredible anthem&lt;/a&gt; for love of baseball, really for any team that is not the NY Yankees or the Los Angeles Dodgers. It's why we don't want Yankees fans at Mets games, they stink up the joint with their obsession about winning. We love the Mets win or lose. It's a game of philosophy not winning or losing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Link ad-blocking and VRM?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a thought for Doc Searls, who has been pushing the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management&quot;&gt;VRM&lt;/a&gt; for a number of years. This may be the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of users have turned off ads altogether. Fed up with the crap that publishers are putting on their pages. We thought we got rid of that when we stopped buying Windows machines, with all their shovel-ware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with ads turned off, we've taken an extreme position. Perhaps it's time to start a negotiation. Dear publisher, here's a list of products I like to keep up to date on. You may include ads related to this. As soon as you stray too far off course, I'll remove the item from my list. If you don't respect the list, I'll just turn off ads again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something is better than nothing. And even if the idea didn't actually get implemented, discussing it on the net would change the way people think, help VRM get more of the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Yankees fans not welcome</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In most things I'm a big believer of inclusiveness. But there are exceptions. One of them is Yankees fans &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/nyregion/mets-fans-bristle-as-their-pinstriped-cousins-muscle-in-on-their-moment.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;celebrating&lt;/a&gt; a Mets victory. It's so totally like Yankees fans to want to be in on the fun. Because that's what they're about, winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;I remember in Y2K when the Yankees beat the Mets in the World Series. The Yankees offered to let the Mets march in their parade down Broadway. A nice ticker-tape affair. The Mets response: No thanks. We'll march when we win. And btw, you won't be marching with us then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time for the Yankees clan to grow up. Your team lost. You are losers. When the Mets win, you are still losers. Deal with it. We are not you and you are not us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Factored to the max</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When developers are testing, we have a set of short bits of text we have memorized to enter into the software without thinking. That works great if no one is watching. Well this is one of those times when I have to test the software while people are watching. So I feel it somewhat necessary to explain why I'm typing lyrics to an old stupid song I sang when I was a kid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Morning baseball notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thought about the Mets. Apparently while they were losing all those games in September after clinching, they were devising new tactics that they used in the playoffs. All of a sudden they're a base-running team, for example. And they got all the pitching problems ironed out. And Murphy started taking some magic drug and now all of a sudden he's a legendary home run hitter. One of his teammates said they were playing with Babe Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Mets team is one for the ages. And although the Mets probably don't know it they owe their success to Patrick Scoble and myself. We've probably been to a dozen Mets games together over the last three years. And the Mets have won every single one. We can't claim full credit for the turnaround, but then again, the really are no coincidences in baseball. Every fan knows that. &lt;img title='wink' alt='wink' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes the Mets are lovable losers, but not like the Cubs, because we win. They have Wrigley Field, a venerable palace of baseball, a shrine for the ages. But there's been so much losing there, it's virtually impossible for them to break out. If they want to achieve the elusive world championship they feel they deserve, it might be a good idea to tear down the stadium and start over. Or accept their new fate, as the team the Mets beat in the postseason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Sorry Cubs fans, the Mets are not the Yankees</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Cubs would have you believe that because the Mets and Yankees both have stadiums within the confines of NYC that somehow playing the Mets in 2015 is like playing the Yankees in 2004.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Whatever gets you through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. That's fucking insulting. The Mets have soul and philosophy. And humility. The Yankees? They have none of that. They are arrogant and condescending and by the way they didn't even make it to the ALDS this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The Cubbies &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; they were playing the Yankees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then they have their two aces starting after that and &quot;anything could happen.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, thanks -- I guess we'd better hope and pray the Mets do it tonight. Maybe we can get Cespedes to get on base. Or Murphy to hit a double, or maybe even a home run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't tempt fate by being overconfident, but it's only happened once folks, and that was the Yankees. The perfect example of overconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I find it insulting that they call the Mets &quot;a New York team&quot; as if they have anything in common with the Yankees. Please. Study up on your NY baseball.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was a very weird experience. I was very very cold the whole game, at times intolerably so. Not sure why, I was well-dressed. I basically went to the game in winter attire. Last week it was summer, btw. Bike riding weather. And it will be again later this week. We just got hit by a blast of winter in time for the Mets to go up 2-0 in the series with the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mets are going far this season. It feels like a sweep of Chicago might be possible. And after that, if we make it (praise Murphy!) I feel we will be very competitive against the likely opponent, the KC Royals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mets are magic this year! :-0&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>JSON changes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes to the JSON format for a chatlog item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No more type of &quot;blogpost&quot;. Basically everything was a blogpost. So if the type element isn't in the payload, it should behave as what we used to call a blogpost. We still check against the type being blogpost because there are data files out there that have this value in it, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an item is updated it gets two new elements: whenLastUpdate and ctUpdates. If an item doesn't have these, you can assume it hasn't been updated after it was posted. (Trying to keep the size of the item small.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change I will make tomorrow when it's clear these changes didn't cause breakage: Add an element to the payload that indicates which editor created the item, wizzy or markdown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/data/2015/10/18/00099.json&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a JSON version of a chat item (this one).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;New feature in the liveblog panel of the new Scripting News home page. There's now a popup menu. Most of the commands are disabled, but two are not: Permalink and Hoist. I'm not going to explain either of them, because when you try them I think their purpose will be self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just sent a screen shot of this page to a very small number of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In case you decided to see if that was a mock-up or if it was for real, it's for real. I have a very user-friendly interface for entering and editing material on this page. &lt;em&gt;It is not an outliner.&lt;/em&gt; I am sure you would think it is from the layout, but it is not. It's something different. I think nicer for this application, believe it or not. Yes, I actually did say that. &lt;img title='wink' alt='wink' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was me doing my NakedJen imitation. &lt;img title='kiss' alt='kiss' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/kiss.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Getting close</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe I am getting close to being ready to post from this liveblog to the &lt;em&gt;Liveblog&lt;/em&gt; panel on Scripting News.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's been there until now has been an experiment. Just to create the first connection between the two worlds. It's like building a bridge, you start with a thin, temporary piece of wire, and use that to haul up a bunch of thicker wires. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I may have just fixed the problems with emoji display in the Liveblog tab on Scripting News. &lt;img title='kiss' alt='kiss' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/kiss.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Partially fixed.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying watching a Game 5 where I don't care about the outcome. Forced to pick I'd go with Toronto because I have friends who live there, and it's not Texas. &lt;img title='wink' alt='wink' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/wink.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: Ted Howard, who lives in Dallas, points out that I have friends in Texas too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow it's the Mets turn. I'm not looking forward to that. The only way I'll enjoy the game is if it's a Mets blowout. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told it's still a little nerve-wracking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>How items work in the liveblog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of the liveblog is that it's more casual. Doesn't require as much forethought. Items don't require titles. They don't have to be very long. But they aren't limited in length either, and you can if you want put a title on an item. And oh yes, you can edit them after publishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
