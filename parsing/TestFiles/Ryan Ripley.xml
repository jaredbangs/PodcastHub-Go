<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Allen Holub (<a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub">@allenholub</a>) joined me (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley">@RyanRipley</a>) for a discussion about #NoEstimates, #NoManagement and what it truly means for an organization to adopt agility. Allen is a trainer, writer, speaker, and coach who takes a non-tribal view of software development and eschews the dogma that surrounds many of the current agile topics and practices.</p>
<p>Allen recently gave a keynote at DevWeek 2015 on #NoEstimates where he opened with: <strong>“We just need to stop doing all estimation now.”</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVBlnCTu9Ms" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with #NoEstimates, Allen I discussed what it truly means for an organization to adopt agility, why such a transformation is so difficult, and how Kanban wrapped around a waterfall can make life easier for both companies and coaches.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with a discussion on #NoManagement and Holocracy.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Vasco Duarte (<a href="https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco">@duarte_vasco</a>) joined Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley">@RyanRipley</a>) for a discussion about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a>. Vasco is the author of the #NoEstimates Book, Founder of Oikosofy, and host of the Scrum Master ToolBox Podcast.</p>
<p>One of the staring points of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> is: <strong>“We as an industry are not able to estimate well.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>We as an industry are not able to estimate well.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=We+as+an+industry+are+not+able+to+estimate+well.&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=http://ryanripley.com/noestimates-with-vasco-duarte/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>With that starting point, alternatives are necessary. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> seeks to explore those alternatives.</p>
<p>We started with Vasco’s early days of discovering the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> path. It started with data. I won’t steal Vasco’s thunder, but it was interesting to learn how much many of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> ideas are driven by actual project data from a variety of sources.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Software projects are a search for value. My goal is to find value. @duarte_vasco</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Software+projects+are+a+search+for+value.+My+goal+is+to+find+value.+%40duarte_vasco&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=http://ryanripley.com/noestimates-with-vasco-duarte/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>We then moved on to cover many of the questions that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> critics and skeptics ask when hearing these ideas for the first time. How to pick one project over another, how to align with project dependencies and more are covered during our hour together.</p>
<p>Finally, we touched on the kind of environments where <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash">#NoEstimates</a> is not an option:</p>
<blockquote><p>In cases where you are not allowed to experiment, where you are not allowed to learn, where you have to know everything upfront, you have no option but to speculate about the cost of a particular project.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

Vasco Duarte (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco"&gt;@duarte_vasco&lt;/a&gt;) joined Ryan Ripley (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley"&gt;@RyanRipley&lt;/a&gt;) for a discussion about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash"&gt;#NoEstimates&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley">@RyanRipley</a>) Amitai Schlair (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz">@schmonz</a>) and Bryan Beecham (<a href="https://twitter.com/BillyGarnet">@BillyGarnet</a>) started the show by talking about the great impact that Tim Ottinger (<a href="https://twitter.com/tottinge">@tottinge</a>) has had on their lives and on the agile community.</p>
<p>To learn more about Tim and his thoughts on agile, you can visit his blog:  <a href="http://agileotter.blogspot.com" target="_blank">agileotter.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p>We then jumped over to the #NoEstimates topic where value and impediments to continuous delivery were highlighted. Bryan also went in to the people side of #NoEstimates and finding the value in the work that we do. We spoke about trust in the workplace and how Industrial Logic promotes trust as a core value.</p>
<p>If there is no trust, then there cannot be alignment. Which begs the question: If the people aren’t aligned, how are they supposed to do great work?</p>
<hr />
<p><em>If the people aren’t aligned how are they supposed to do great work?</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=If+the+people+aren%E2%80%99t+aligned+how+are+they+supposed+to+do+great+work%3F&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=http://ryanripley.com/human-refactoring-with-bryan-beecham/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>We also noted that the #NoEstimates discussion on Twitter isn’t “safe” at times and that needs to change for real progress and learning to happen.</p>
<p>We then moved in to the art of human refactoring and how people can implement change in their own lives. We barely scratched the surface of this topic and will tackle it again on a future episode.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

Discussion
Ryan Ripley (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley"&gt;@RyanRipley&lt;/a&gt;) Amitai Schlair (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz"&gt;@schmonz&lt;/a&gt;) and Bryan Beecham (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillyGarnet"&gt;@BillyGarnet&lt;/a&gt;) started the show by talking about the great impact that Tim Ottinger (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tottinge"&gt;@tottinge&lt;/a&gt;) has had on their lives and on the agile community.

To learn more about Tim and his thoughts on agile, you can visit his blog:  &lt;a href="http://agileotter.blogspot.com" target="_blank"&gt;agileotter.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;

We then jumped over to the #NoEstimates topic where value and impediments to continuous delivery were highlighted. Bryan also went in to the people side of #NoEstimates and finding the value in the work that we do. We spoke about trust in the workplace and how Industrial Logic promotes trust as a core value.

If there is no trust, then there cannot be alignment. Which begs the question: If the people aren’t aligned, how are they supposed to do great work?

[Tweet "If the people aren’t aligned how are they supposed to do great work?"]

We also noted that the #NoEstimates discussion on Twitter isn’t “safe” at times and that needs to change for real progress and learning to happen.

We then moved in to the art of human refactoring and how people can implement change in their own lives. We barely scratched the surface of this topic and will tackle it again on a future episode.

And then…we called it a night.

<p>Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley">@ryanripley</a>) Esther Derby (<a href="https://twitter.com/estherderby">@estherderby</a>) Don Gray (<a href="https://twitter.com/donaldegray">@donaldegray</a>) and Amitai Schlair (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz">@schmonz</a>) got together to discuss the vast topic of “trust”.</p>
<p>We covered how to establish trust with a new team, how trust impacts the scrum master role, and how easily managers can lose the trust of their teams. Agile coaches can set expectations early and establish an environment of trust through intentional behaviors and follow through.</p>
<p>This is a nuanced discussion that scratched the surface of how large of an impact trust plays on the success of a team.</p>
<p>We also talked about Ryan&#8217;s horrible laundry skills&#8230;and then we called it a night.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>A rejuvenated Zach Bonaker (<a href="https://twitter.com/zachbonaker">@zachbonaker</a>) joined Dan Greening (<a href="https://twitter.com/greening" target="_blank">@greening</a>) and Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley">@ryanripley</a>) to talk about #NoEstimates and some of the limitations of not estimating work. We quickly moved on from that topic to an area that Dan has put a lot of work in to: <strong>What are the patterns that agile organization exhibit?</strong> In other words, how do we know that we are agile?</p>
<p>Dan has expressed his thoughts on what it means to be agile within <a href="http://senexrex.com/are-we-agile/">5 base patterns</a> that he explained to Zach and Ryan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measure economic progress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limit work in progress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Embrace collective responsibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solve systemic problems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From there the discussion pivoted to top down vs. bottom up agile transformations. We discussed how they work, the pitfalls of each, and our personal experiences with trying to help organizations adopt agile. <strong>Management must be the first mover when adopting agile, followed by the rest of the company.</strong> Dan gave a few cautionary tales of what happens if management does not adapt along with the rest of the organization.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">@RyanRipley</a>) Amitai Schlair (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz" target="_blank">@schmonz</a>) and Arlo Belshee (<a href="https://twitter.com/arlobelshee" target="_blank">@arlobelshee</a>) covered one of the most diverse agendas ever covered on the podcast. We started with a discussion about scaling agile, the limitations of frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and DaD.</p>
<p>We then moved on to the limits that consistency puts on innovation and how tuning consistency can be a serious competitive advantage. However, this is complicated task because “<strong>anytime we are going for consistency we are necessarily hurting innovation in that same space.</strong>”</p>
<p>Next we discussed the controversial topic of refactoring vs test driven development (TDD). Arlo described his views on the differences between the two skills and ways that teams can work to refactor their designs safely &#8211; with tools &#8211; so that the code can then be come testable using TDD practices.</p>
<p>On the TDD side of the discussion the group agreed that “<strong>a unit test that uses mocks is not a unit test.</strong>” Mocks are a smell that can reveal design issues within your code. Arlo also provided ideas about how to work without mocks and improve designs.</p>
<p>Finally, we covered hiring people for emotional intelligence instead of skills. If smart, inquisitive people can be taught programming and other related skills quickly (~6 months) then what advantage does hiring for skills really bring to a team? <strong>Couldn’t it be better to hire for empathy and culture first if skill are cheap to grow…especially in a pair/mob-programming environments?</strong></p>
<p>The answers to these questions and how this mindset shifts hiring led to an interesting conversation about how such thinking can help companies build innovative and effective teams.</p>

Discussion
Ryan Ripley (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank"&gt;@RyanRipley&lt;/a&gt;) Amitai Schlair (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz" target="_blank"&gt;@schmonz&lt;/a&gt;) and Arlo Belshee (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arlobelshee" target="_blank"&gt;@arlobelshee&lt;/a&gt;) covered one of the most diverse agendas ever covered on the podcast. We started with a discussion about scaling agile, the limitations of frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and DaD.

We then moved on to the limits that consistency puts on innovation and how tuning consistency can be a serious competitive advantage. However, this is complicated task because “anytime we are going for consistency we are necessarily hurting innovation in that same space.”

Next we discussed the controversial topic of refactoring vs test driven development (TDD). Arlo described his views on the differences between the two skills and ways that teams can work to refactor their designs safely - with tools - so that the code can then be come testable using TDD practices.

On the TDD side of the discussion the group agreed that “a unit test that uses mocks is not a unit test.” Mocks are a smell that can reveal design issues within your code. Arlo also provided ideas about how to work without mocks and improve designs.

Finally, we covered hiring people for emotional intelligence instead of skills. If smart, inquisitive people can be taught programming and other related skills quickly (~6 months) then what advantage does hiring for skills really bring to a team? Couldn’t it be better to hire for empathy and culture first if skill are cheap to grow…especially in a pair/mob-programming environments?

The answers to these questions and how this mindset shifts hiring led to an interesting conversation about how such thinking can help companies build innovative and effective teams.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">@RyanRipley</a>) Tim Ottinger (<a href="https://twitter.com/tottinge" target="_blank">@tottinge</a>) and Don Gray (<a href="https://twitter.com/donaldegray" target="_blank">@donaldegray</a>) got together to talk about the word “enterprise”. Quite a few connotations were thrown around: inertia, masses of people, waterfall. Better, Faster, Cheaper was even discussed. We moved on to talking about the limitations imposed on scaling by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" target="_blank">Dunbar’s Number</a> (150) and then learned about the Rule of the 2nd Floor:</p>
<p><em>“Nobody 2 levels above or below you in the organization really understands what you do for a living.”</em></p>
<p>The discussion then shifted to how we can do Agile with 5,000 people. Typical scaling patterns emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale by Division:</strong>  Dividing people in to functional teams.</li>
<li><strong>Scale Out, Not Up</strong>:  Group people in to feature teams.</li>
<li><strong>Holocracy:</strong>  Peer to peer organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/" target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a> (XP) and other disciplined software engineering practices to improve team outcome were discussed as was an organizationals ability to move up the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html" target="_blank">Agile Fluency Model</a>. We talked about <a href="http://www.leadingagile.com/2015/08/name-calling-and-ad-hominem-attacks/" target="_blank">Mike Cottmeyer’s recent post</a> about stopping the anti-management rhetoric and finding ways to meet management where they are and help them find the path to an agile organization.</p>
<p>The discussion then shifted to how teams can measure their agility and the renaissance of craftsmanship in the software development world.</p>
<p>Don walked us through transformation management theory, we asked why organizations should even go “agile” in the first place, and worked on a definition of &#8220;agile&#8221; in the enterprise.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Aaron Griffith (<a href="https://twitter.com/Aaron_Griffith" target="_blank">@aaron_griffith</a>) is a member of the Hunter #mobprogramming team, agile speaker, and #NoEstimates enthusiast. He joined Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">@ryanripley</a>) to talk about agile in a galaxy far far away, agile coach camp (#accus) experiences, and a bonus topic from the <a href="http://agilecoachingcards.com/" target="_blank">Agile Coaching Cards</a> Lean Coffee volume 1 deck.</p>
<p>We started with Aaron’s talk about agile and Star Wars. During this talk, Aaron compares and contrast the Republic and the Galactic Empire to an agile team. Using movie quotes and scenes he brings to life agile concepts and practices in ways that newcomers to agile can relate with and understand. He’s received great feedback on this talk and will be giving it again at <a href="http://www.agiletestingdays.com/">Agile Testing Days</a> in Potsdam, Germany &#8211; November 9th-12th.</p>
<p>We then moved on to our time at <a href="http://agilecoachcampus.com/">Agile Coach Camp 2015</a>. We were both able to attend some interesting sessions. Ryan shared his experiences discussing the business side of agile and telling stories with <a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank">Woody Zuill</a>. Aaron explained insights learned in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobProgramming?src=hash" target="_blank">#MobProgramming</a> sessions and gave his overall thoughts on his first visit to a coach camp.</p>
<p>Finally, we wrapped up by doing a quick Lean Coffee session using Victor Bonacci’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/agilecoffee">@agilecoffee</a>) new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/770793397/agile-coaching-cards" target="_blank">agile coaching cards deck</a>. We pulled the “<em>Dealing with bullies, naysayers, and other bad apples</em>” card and shared stories and insights from past experiences with difficult agile team members.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

Discussion
Aaron Griffith (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Aaron_Griffith" target="_blank"&gt;@aaron_griffith&lt;/a&gt;) is a member of the Hunter #mobprogramming team, agile speaker, and #NoEstimates enthusiast. He joined Ryan Ripley (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank"&gt;@ryanripley&lt;/a&gt;) to talk about agile in a galaxy far far away, agile coach camp (#accus) experiences, and a bonus topic from the &lt;a href="http://agilecoachingcards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Agile Coaching Cards&lt;/a&gt; Lean Coffee volume 1 deck.

We started with Aaron’s talk about agile and Star Wars. During this talk, Aaron compares and contrast the Republic and the Galactic Empire to an agile team. Using movie quotes and scenes he brings to life agile concepts and practices in ways that newcomers to agile can relate with and understand. He’s received great feedback on this talk and will be giving it again at &lt;a href="http://www.agiletestingdays.com/"&gt;Agile Testing Days&lt;/a&gt; in Potsdam, Germany - November 9th-12th.

We then moved on to our time at &lt;a href="http://agilecoachcampus.com/"&gt;Agile Coach Camp 2015&lt;/a&gt;. We were both able to attend some interesting sessions. Ryan shared his experiences discussing the business side of agile and telling stories with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank"&gt;Woody Zuill&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron explained insights learned in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobProgramming?src=hash" target="_blank"&gt;#MobProgramming&lt;/a&gt; sessions and gave his overall thoughts on his first visit to a coach camp.

Finally, we wrapped up by doing a quick Lean Coffee session using Victor Bonacci’s (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agilecoffee"&gt;@agilecoffee&lt;/a&gt;) new &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/770793397/agile-coaching-cards" target="_blank"&gt;agile coaching cards deck&lt;/a&gt;. We pulled the “Dealing with bullies, naysayers, and other bad apples” card and shared stories and insights from past experiences with difficult agile team members.

And then…we called it a night.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>It’s a miracle that this episode happened. Zach Bonaker (<a href="https://twitter.com/ZachBonaker" target="_blank">@zachbonaker</a>) got lost in an English bog, Amitai Schlair (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz" target="_blank">@schmonz</a>) was wandering in Guatemala and Ryan Ripley (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">@ryanripley</a>) was nearly sucked in to the power fueled DC world, but the three managed to come together to ponder some questions about coaching agile teams.</p>
<h3>WHEN DOES AN AGILE TEAM NEED COACHING?</h3>
<p>We started with defining coaching, then mentoring, and finally consulting. And ultimately came upon an important insight. If the team knows how to learn together and has a high level of skill in conducting retrospectives, they likely need little coaching. However, such stars rarely align. We discussed if the team should choose when a coach is needed, and managements role in the process. We then moved on to our next question:</p>
<h3>WHEN SHOULD AN AGILE COACH LEAVE?</h3>
<p>When the checks start to bounce, of course! This is another difficult situation to handle. It takes a great amount of awareness to realize that the team can find success without you (the coach). Watching the teams behaviors, the systems they are working within, and the response they have to the coach are all important considerations. On the other hand, we did discuss that in professional sports, the coach never leaves. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=22&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJEBEBYwFWoVChMIld2WgP_HxwIVip-ACh15wAGe&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2502577-lebron-james-is-officially-nbas-hardest-player-to-coach&amp;ei=2lfeVZWIDoq_ggT5gIfwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqQ-cYEKeaYAuSQSLfi_CAdhhpEA&amp;sig2=HA1p6yTh7wsV86utxi0-UQ" target="_blank">Even LeBron James has a coach</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation then pivoted in to agile transformations. At the heart our discussion was the idea of <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/encourage-your-scrum-team-during-an-agile-transformation/" target="_blank">influence vs coercion</a> and how coercion can tank an agile transformation quickly. The tendency to hold on the old practices, even harmful ones, is hard to break as teams new to agile often struggle to embrace self-organization. Trust was also a key theme throughout.</p>
<p>Amitai was kind enough to share <a href="https://agilein3minut.es/8/" target="_blank">episode 8 (care)</a> of his podcast: <a href="https://agilein3minut.es/" target="_blank">Agile in 3 Minutes</a>. He creates art each week by focusing on one agile idea each week. Insightful and poetic, Agile in 3 Minutes is clearly a labor of love that I’m grateful to enjoy each week. I hope you give Agile in 3 Minutes a listen and <a href="https://agilein3minut.es/archive/index.rss" target="_blank">subscribe via rss here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Zach told us about <a href="https://twitter.com/agilecoffee" target="_blank">Victor Bonacci’s</a> recent <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/770793397/agile-coaching-cards" target="_blank">Kickstarter project: Agile Coaching Cards</a>. Vic was a <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/011-agile-for-humans/" target="_blank">recent guest on Agile for Humans</a> and taught us how to play <a href="http://leancoffee.org/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee</a>. He’s now selling a deck of cards on Kickstarter designed to help teams get up to speed quickly with Lean Coffee discussion. This is a fun tool that can help teams facilitate conversations about agile topics.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Woody Zuill (<a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank">@WoodyZuill</a>) joined Zach and Ryan to talk about experimentation in Agile. Woody talked about his early experiences in the workforce and the need to investigate. These experiences taught him to never take anything for granted and to be inquisitive about all things. This lead to one of his key mantras: <strong>Question the things that you have the most faith in.</strong></p>
<p>We then moved on to The Pattern of Continuous No Improvement. This phenomenon occurs when teams set out to correct the same issue sprint over sprint but cannot seem to make progress. Often this pattern is caused by not addressing the root cause of the issue. We talked about 5 why’s as one means to discovering the root cause. We also talked about the team’s need to recognize this pattern and to confront it head on.</p>
<p><a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/category/noestimates/" target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a> was born from this insight as a team tried repeatedly to improve their estimates but continued to miss that goal. Finally the team decided to work without task estimates and found some improvement and later on, success.</p>
<p><a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/category/mobprogramming/" target="_blank">#MobProgramming</a> is another idea brought to the agile world by Woody. He described its origin as an impromptu presentation during Agile 2012. Fortunately, that open jam session was popular and an important conversation about how teams get their work done was born.</p>
<p>Asking the inverse of a question was highlighted as a powerful probing technique, especially during retrospectives. We all agreed that frequent retros bring valuable insights to the team and that effective mob programming is fueled by effective retrospectives.</p>
<p>The discussion then shifted to how teams can measure their agility and the renaissance of craftsmanship in the software development world.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">Ryan Ripley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/agileAgitator" target="_blank">Ron Quartel</a></p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Ron Quartel (<a href="https://twitter.com/agileAgitator" target="_blank">@AgileAgitator</a>) is an agile coach, blogger (<a href="http://blog.agileagitator.com/" target="_blank">blog.agileagitator.com</a>) and the creator of the FAST Agile framework.</p>
<p>The FAST Agile (<a href="http://www.fast-agile.com" target="_blank">www.fast-agile.com</a>) is a combination of Open Space Technology, Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and Story Mapping. After watching hundreds of participants use open space technology to organize and hold a conference, Ron decided that such self-organization practices could also be applied to software development.</p>
<p>Rather than relying control mechanisms like <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a> and <a href="http://less.works/" target="_blank">LeSS</a>, FAST Agile is a scalable agile framework that relies and individuals and interactions along with pulling work in to teams. Utilizing a 2 day sprint, FAST Agile implicitly requires teams to break their work down in to small chunks and to swarm the work in a <a href="http://mobprogramming.org/" target="_blank">#MobProgramming</a> fashion.</p>
<p>Documentation on the FAST Agile framework can be found at (<a href="http://www.fast-agile.com" target="_blank">www.fast-agile.com</a>).</p>
<p>We then moved on to the pain points of agile coaching, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing bad scrum implementations over and over again</li>
<li>Lack of XP usage on scrum teams</li>
<li>Mis-understanding of what makes scrum work</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially surprising is the low adoption rates of XP on scrum teams. According to the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/landing-pages/2015-state-of-scrum-report-download" target="_blank">Scrum Alliance State of Scrum Survey 2015</a>, only 16% of scrum teams also practice XP. The Version One survey had the usage rate even lower. <a href="http://agile2015.sched.org/rquartel1#.VbluFZuh2Uk" target="_blank">Ron is giving a talk at Agile 2015 about using Scrum and XP for Hyper-productivity</a>. If you’re going to be in DC for the “<a href="http://agilealliance.org/" target="_blank">big conference</a>” this is a must see session.</p>
<p>Finally, we wrapped up with a conversation about agile certifications. While the classes are good, <a href="http://blog.agileagitator.com/2015/07/say-no-to-agile-certification-and-fall.html" target="_blank">Ron questions the value of “certifying” CSM’s after a 2-day course</a>. He started the #SayNoToAgileCertifications and hopes to see improvements in this area.</p>
<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your estimate is a guess.</strong> It expires and it changes. In <a href="http://amzn.to/1D7pgLw" target="_blank">Predicting the Unpredictable</a>, <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/" target="_blank">Johanna Rothman</a> provides practical tips that increase trust, reduces bad management (hopefully), and helps teams transparently deliver valuable software to their customers.</p>

<p>I once inherited a failing project that simply could not fail. A mission critical application had to be replaced, otherwise products would not get loaded in to catalogs, point of sale systems, and online stores. <strong>Millions of dollars at risk.</strong></p>
<p>This project had a lot of common problems. <strong>The planning and estimates were unrealistic.</strong> The features being looked at were too big to be understood and team members were working on multiple projects. Every feature was top priority and many of the features didn’t even exits in the current system.</p>
<p><strong>Worst of all, the stakeholders no longer trusted the project team to deliver.</strong></p>
<p>We needed a prioritized backlog of only the features required to replace the legacy system. It took time and coaching, but we were able to get a few sprints worth of prioritized stories back from our stakeholder. For the first time in months the team delivered a completed feature at the end of the first sprint.</p>
<p>Gradually, the stakeholders came back to the table as we continued to deliver and a great relationship formed. We collaboratively worked off of a product backlog and gained a shared understanding of the project. The were still difficult moments, but <strong>the trust was back and features made their way to production</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What weren’t we doing? Estimating.</strong> Our ability to deliver and build trust with the stakeholders removed the need to provide estimates. They knew roughly how many features we could deliver in a sprint and the cost of the team was a simple run rate calculation.</p>
<p><strong>We focused on working software and got great results.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“There is an alternative to estimating. Make your features small, as in something you can deliver in a day or so. If you finish something each day, people can see your work product. They trust you. They stop asking you for estimates.” — <em>Johanna Rothman, “<a href="http://amzn.to/1D7pgLw" target="_blank">Predicting the Unpredictable</a>&#8220;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>How can you move to this kind of collaboration? <a href="http://amzn.to/1D7pgLw" target="_blank">Predicting the Unpredictable: Pragmatic Approaches to Estimating Project Schedule or Cost</a> by Johanna Rothman provides ideas and suggestions to improve your team’s processes and ability to deliver value back to your stakeholders.</p>
<p>Rothman challenges the reader to consider why they estimate. “If you estimate because you always have, think about it.”</p>
<p>Management will continue to ask “<strong>How much will this project cost?</strong>” and “<strong>How long will it take?</strong>”. It’s how you answer that can make the difference on your projects.</p>
<p>Do you know the “do’s and don’ts” of providing estimates to your management? If not, Chapter 5: “Think About Estimates” will help you out. Have a fixed date and scope and are unsure what to do? That’s covered in Chapter 6. How do you coach a manager who still needs to know “when and how much”? Chapter 9 has your answers.</p>
<p>These are just some of the topics that Rothman covers for those who must fill the need of providing an estimate. For others, she provides a means to focus on working software and a rationale for doing so.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When creating software, I want to see working software as we create it, because with working software, we learn.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a practical book about the work of creating software and providing estimates when needed. Her estimation troubleshooting guide highlights many of the hidden issues with estimating such as: <strong>multitasking, student syndrome, using the wrong units to estimate, and trying to estimates things that are too big</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an immensely practical book that belongs on the shelf of anyone working on an agile team. The practical suggestions on how to handle providing estimates is worth the prices of the book, making the coverage of advanced topics like #NoEstimates a welcome bonus. <strong>Highly recommended!</strong></p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Victor is an independent consultant who hosts the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agile-coffee-podcast/id880524138">Agile Coffee Podcast</a>. He helped organize this years <a href="http://agilegathering.com">Agile Coach Camp US West</a> in California, and participates in many local events on the west coast.</p>
<p>We started the discussion on our involvement in the agile community and some of the conferences that we enjoy. We’re both connected by our love of the <a href="http://htt[://agilecoachcamp.us" target="_blank">Agile Coach Camp</a> conferences are both looking forward to this years meeting later in July in Washington DC.</p>
<p>The topic shifted to podcasting. We both host podcasts, product podcasts, and listen to podcasts. We fielded some of the questions that we sometimes get such as:</p>
<p>Which agile podcasts do we listen to &#8211; other than <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agile-coffee-podcast/id880524138?mt=2">Agile Coffee</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/agile-for-humans-podcast-devoted/id991671232?mt=2">Agile for Humans</a>?</p>

Discussion
Victor is an independent consultant who hosts the &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agile-coffee-podcast/id880524138"&gt;Agile Coffee Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He helped organize this years &lt;a href="http://agilegathering.com"&gt;Agile Coach Camp US West&lt;/a&gt; in California, and participates in many local events on the west coast.

We started the discussion on our involvement in the agile community and some of the conferences that we enjoy. We’re both connected by our love of the &lt;a href="http://htt[://agilecoachcamp.us" target="_blank"&gt;Agile Coach Camp&lt;/a&gt; conferences are both looking forward to this years meeting later in July in Washington DC.

The topic shifted to podcasting. We both host podcasts, product podcasts, and listen to podcasts. We fielded some of the questions that we sometimes get such as:

Which agile podcasts do we listen to - other than &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agile-coffee-podcast/id880524138?mt=2"&gt;Agile Coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/agile-for-humans-podcast-devoted/id991671232?mt=2"&gt;Agile for Humans&lt;/a&gt;?

	&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/scrum-master-toolbox-podcast/id963592988?mt=2"&gt;Scrum Master Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;

How do you produce and record your shows?

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We opened the discussion by defining the critic&#8217;s view against <strong>#NoEstimates</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.peterkretzman.com/2014/09/24/the-case-against-noestimates-part-1-introduction-and-common-sense/" target="_blank">Estimates are natural, ubiquitous, useful, and unavoidable in practical life and in business. Estimates are an important part of the process of collaboratively setting reasonable targets, goals, and commitments within an organization. The process of estimating, in and of itself, has by-products and benefits. Given that a rational estimating process is an integral part of making decisions in the presence of uncertainty, it is hard to understand why anyone would state that a desirable goal is to push forward into limiting estimates; down to zero where possible.</a> &#8211;Peter Kretzman</p></blockquote>
<p>From there the discussion flowed in multiple directions as we discuss the many areas of agreement that we have with some of the <strong>#NoEstimates</strong> critics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of estimating, in and of itself, has by-products and benefits far beyond the sheer “number” or other indicator of sizing that emerges at the end.</li>
<li>When asking for estimates, management is acting benevolently and is looking to have a need met.</li>
<li>Abuse of estimates is poor management and a sign of dysfunction</li>
<li>The word &#8220;estimates&#8221;, as used in our debates, has been interpreted in a wide array of possibilities &#8211; from guesses to predictions.</li>
<li>It’s reasonable to feel a sense of shock here. It sounds like people are saying to “just stop giving estimates” and leave managers hanging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the conversation we shared what we have learned from the interaction with the critics and worked on clarifying many of these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambiguity around the <strong>#NoEstimates</strong> tag and the lack of civility demonstrated at times by those supporting NE has damaged the discussion and limited collaboration.</li>
<li>The connection between agile principles &amp; values and <strong>#NoEstimates</strong> is not clear.</li>
<li>The role of systems thinking in the approach to minimizing the role of estimates is also not clear.</li>
<li>The field of &#8220;professional estimating&#8221; is highly complex, sophisticated, and dedicated to continuously improving the quantitative practice of estimating software development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining time was spent on systems thinking, pre-conditions necessary to question estimation processes and value, and the role of excellent engineering practices in reducing the role of estimates in a software delivery system. Then, we called it a night.</p>

Discussion
We opened the discussion by defining the critic's view against #NoEstimates:
&lt;a href="http://www.peterkretzman.com/2014/09/24/the-case-against-noestimates-part-1-introduction-and-common-sense/" target="_blank"&gt;Estimates are natural, ubiquitous, useful, and unavoidable in practical life and in business. Estimates are an important part of the process of collaboratively setting reasonable targets, goals, and commitments within an organization. The process of estimating, in and of itself, has by-products and benefits. Given that a rational estimating process is an integral part of making decisions in the presence of uncertainty, it is hard to understand why anyone would state that a desirable goal is to push forward into limiting estimates; down to zero where possible.&lt;/a&gt; --Peter Kretzman
From there the discussion flowed in multiple directions as we discuss the many areas of agreement that we have with some of the #NoEstimates critics:

	The process of estimating, in and of itself, has by-products and benefits far beyond the sheer “number” or other indicator of sizing that emerges at the end.
	When asking for estimates, management is acting benevolently and is looking to have a need met.
	Abuse of estimates is poor management and a sign of dysfunction
	The word "estimates", as used in our debates, has been interpreted in a wide array of possibilities - from guesses to predictions.
	It’s reasonable to feel a sense of shock here. It sounds like people are saying to “just stop giving estimates” and leave managers hanging.

Throughout the conversation we shared what we have learned from the interaction with the critics and worked on clarifying many of these areas:

	Ambiguity around the #NoEstimates tag and the lack of civility demonstrated at times by those supporting NE has damaged the discussion and limited collaboration.
	The connection between agile principles &amp; values and #NoEstimates is not clear.
	The role of systems thinking in the approach to minimizing the role of estimates is also not clear.
	The field of "professional estimating" is highly complex, sophisticated, and dedicated to continuously improving the quantitative practice of estimating software development.

The remaining time was spent on systems thinking, pre-conditions necessary to question estimation processes and value, and the role of excellent engineering practices in reducing the role of estimates in a software delivery system. Then, we called it a night.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Amitai started our night with a recap of his experiences at the <a href="http://www.estherderby.com/problem-solving-leadership-psl">Problem Solving Leadership (PSL)</a> course led by <a href="https://twitter.com/estherderby">Esther Derby</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryWeinberg">Jerry Weinberg</a>. The PSL course teaches leaders how to think and act clearly during a wide range of situations. Amitai and many other have recommended it highly as a valuable course for getting to the next level of leadership.</p>
<p>We then moved on to conference recaps. Amitai presented at <a href="http://www.agileroots.com/">Agile Roots</a> and made Ryan regret not going. Ryan presented at the <a href="http://adcwest.techwell.com/">Agile Development Conference West</a> in Las Vegas and got some great feedback on his well received talk about managers in an agile environment.</p>
<p>JB Rainsberger found some slack in his schedule and joined us for a great discussion about organizations dysfunction, the <a href="http://www.ayeconference.com/">Amplify Your Effectiveness (AYE) conference</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobProgramming?src=hash">Mob Programming</a>, and Rebooting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">XP</a>.</p>
<p>We dropped a few book recommendations along the way. Talked about the joys of living in Canada, and wrapped up with some thoughts about the next generation of developers entering the market and how they can have a strong, humane influence on the software development culture. Then, we called it a night.</p>

The PSL course teaches leaders how to think and act clearly during a wide range of situations. Amitai and many other have recommended it highly as a valuable course for getting to the next level of leadership.

We then moved on to conference recaps. Amitai presented at &lt;a href="http://www.agileroots.com/"&gt;Agile Roots&lt;/a&gt; and made Ryan regret not going. Ryan presented at the &lt;a href="http://adcwest.techwell.com/"&gt;Agile Development Conference West&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas and got some great feedback on his well received talk about managers in an agile environment.

JB Rainsberger found some slack in his schedule and joined us for a great discussion about organizations dysfunction, the &lt;a href="http://www.ayeconference.com/"&gt;Amplify Your Effectiveness (AYE) conference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobProgramming?src=hash"&gt;Mob Programming&lt;/a&gt;, and Rebooting &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.

We dropped a few book recommendations along the way. Talked about the joys of living in Canada, and wrapped up with some thoughts about the next generation of developers entering the market and how they can have a strong, humane influence on the software development culture. Then, we called it a night.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>#NoEstimates means many different things to many different people. The group defined #NoEstimates as a conversation around when estimates are appropriate and to which level of precision teams should target. We noted that the hashtag can lead to more “heat than light”, but also acknowledged that a rich conversation has formed around the questions that #NoEstimates poses.</p>
<p>We moved on to discussing estimates being useful at a portfolio level for deciding which projects to do and to forecast budgets. To some this did not go far enough and we continued to highlight other benefits of estimating such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversations that occur when estimating</li>
<li>Shared understand of programming activities</li>
<li>Enabling decision making at the executive level</li>
<li>Validating project/program/product assumptions</li>
<li>Indication of possible issues when reality and the estimate do not match</li>
</ul>
<p>When discussing when estimates are needed, there are no stock answers. George highlighted the need to <strong>meet the expressed needs of those seeking estimates</strong>. Once that is understood, we can determine an appropriate level of precision and act accordingly. JB cautioned against the mindless use of estimates, but everyone agreed that estimates created with a goal of “making good decisions” are useful.</p>
<p>We turned to real world examples where burn-up charts are used to estimate the delivery of programs. This revealed some important considerations about estimates like the need to <strong>build uncertainty in to your estimates, while removing inappropriate levels of precision</strong>. We also covered situations with mandates and fixed dates where estimates may not be as critical as focusing on delivering the software frequently.</p>
<p>Part of improving estimates requires improving software engineering practices. If the team can deliver consistently sprint over the sprint, the creation of estimates can move be performed by the stakeholders. While this type of improvement is difficult, George reminded us that <strong>focusing on the little things can have a great impact of making delivery more predictable</strong>.</p>
<p>To wrap up, we circled back to the idea that we should focus on meeting needs. This aligns well with “individuals and interactions over process and tools”, but is also more difficult to do. <strong>Exploring how to meet needs requires soft skills, trust, and good relationships to succeed.</strong></p>

Discussion
#NoEstimates means many different things to many different people. The group defined #NoEstimates as a conversation around when estimates are appropriate and to which level of precision teams should target. We noted that the hashtag can lead to more “heat than light”, but also acknowledged that a rich conversation has formed around the questions that #NoEstimates poses.

We moved on to discussing estimates being useful at a portfolio level for deciding which projects to do and to forecast budgets. To some this did not go far enough and we continued to highlight other benefits of estimating such as:

	Conversations that occur when estimating
	Shared understand of programming activities
	Enabling decision making at the executive level
	Validating project/program/product assumptions
	Indication of possible issues when reality and the estimate do not match

When discussing when estimates are needed, there are no stock answers. George highlighted the need to meet the expressed needs of those seeking estimates. Once that is understood, we can determine an appropriate level of precision and act accordingly. JB cautioned against the mindless use of estimates, but everyone agreed that estimates created with a goal of “making good decisions” are useful.

We turned to real world examples where burn-up charts are used to estimate the delivery of programs. This revealed some important considerations about estimates like the need to build uncertainty in to your estimates, while removing inappropriate levels of precision. We also covered situations with mandates and fixed dates where estimates may not be as critical as focusing on delivering the software frequently.

Part of improving estimates requires improving software engineering practices. If the team can deliver consistently sprint over the sprint, the creation of estimates can move be performed by the stakeholders. While this type of improvement is difficult, George reminded us that focusing on the little things can have a great impact of making delivery more predictable.

To wrap up, we circled back to the idea that we should focus on meeting needs. This aligns well with “individuals and interactions over process and tools”, but is also more difficult to do. Exploring how to meet needs requires soft skills, trust, and good relationships to succeed.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Agile isn’t simple anymore. We talked at length about the added complexity that has emerged in the agile community and the impact on transformations and projects. Amitai offered a lean start-up approach that we all agreed could be a competitive advantage to companies in years to come. We focused on organizing companies around products to limit risk and maximize value.</p>
<p>We moved on to what’s leading edge and new in the agile world. Bob shared his finding from many informal polls and discussion – that we are not leading edge. 70-90% of people polled acknowledge “bad agile” in their organizations. This has proven consistent when other speakers and coaches pose the questions to large groups and teams.</p>
<p>Next the team discussed meeting the needs of the people we serve and how trust, safety, empathy, compassion, kindness, and love play in to that end. Some of the questions covered include: Is it safe to say you don’t know something? Can you fail quickly in your organization? Do we trust one another to not cause harm in the workplace?</p>
<p>These insights led us down the past of advocating for coaching at the leadership level. This practice is critical as pressure and adversity can cause people to revert to comfortable patterns and practices. Leadership, however, can limit this by “being agile” through thick and thin.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Zach is an independent consultant who recently posted a provocative article called: “The Subversion of Agile: Agile is a Cancer”. We discussed his post, talked about what the cancer is in the community that needs to be removed about posts from others in the community about the “<a href="http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/" target="_blank">death of Agile</a>”.</p>
<p>We moved on to what Agile in a business language would look like &#8211; <a href="http://senexrex.com/category/agile-base-patterns/" target="_blank">agile base patterns</a> &#8211; and he shared some ideas that he and <a href="https://twitter.com/greening" target="_blank">Dan Greening</a> have been contemplating. We discussed the 5 pillars of an agile organization, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure economic progress</li>
<li>Experiment</li>
<li>Limit work in progress</li>
<li>Embrace collective responsibility</li>
<li>Solve systemic problems</li>
</ol>
<p>From there the discussion pivoted to top down vs. bottom up agile transformations. We discuss how they work, the pitfalls of each, and our personal experiences with trying to help organizations adopt agile. Of course I found a way to bring up agile management. We added a few more books to Don’s book club, talked about the difficulty of filling the role of the product owner, and then…called it a night.</p>
<p>Zach was a great guest who I hope becomes a regular contributor to the podcast. He recently posted a follow-up to his original post called “<a href="http://senexrex.com/cure-agile-cancer/" target="_blank">Agile Cancer: Stop Whining and Cure It</a>” which has expanded the conversation, set off a few flame wars, and provoked some important conversations about our industry.</p>

Discussion
Zach is an independent consultant who recently posted a provocative article called: “The Subversion of Agile: Agile is a Cancer”. We discussed his post, talked about what the cancer is in the community that needs to be removed about posts from others in the community about the “&lt;a href="http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/" target="_blank"&gt;death of Agile&lt;/a&gt;”.

We moved on to what Agile in a business language would look like - &lt;a href="http://senexrex.com/category/agile-base-patterns/" target="_blank"&gt;agile base patterns&lt;/a&gt; - and he shared some ideas that he and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greening" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Greening&lt;/a&gt; have been contemplating. We discussed the 5 pillars of an agile organization, which include:

	Measure economic progress
	Experiment
	Limit work in progress
	Embrace collective responsibility
	Solve systemic problems

From there the discussion pivoted to top down vs. bottom up agile transformations. We discuss how they work, the pitfalls of each, and our personal experiences with trying to help organizations adopt agile. Of course I found a way to bring up agile management. We added a few more books to Don’s book club, talked about the difficulty of filling the role of the product owner, and then…called it a night.

Zach was a great guest who I hope becomes a regular contributor to the podcast. He recently posted a follow-up to his original post called “&lt;a href="http://senexrex.com/cure-agile-cancer/" target="_blank"&gt;Agile Cancer: Stop Whining and Cure It&lt;/a&gt;” which has expanded the conversation, set off a few flame wars, and provoked some important conversations about our industry.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agile for Humans is a podcast dedicated to the individuals and interactions that make agile work.</p>
<h2>Hosts</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie" target="_blank">George Dinwiddie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank">Ryan Ripley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz" target="_blank">Amitai Schlair</a></p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>First up was a lively discussion about the life of a consultant. Amitai and George represented the contractor side of the story, while Ryan talked about the full time employee side of the equation. We all agreed that life on the road may not the most glamorous, but the upside can be interesting. We had a quick follow on discussion about whether or not an agile coach needs to have a programming background to be effective.</p>
<p>Next the team moved on to the difficult art of facilitating retrospectives. A recent twitter exchange sparked a conversation about whether or not retrospectives were still needed or if teams should just fix issues in real time. We decided that retrospectives are critical to a teams success, but many of today’s retrospectives suck. We shared some thoughts on how to make retros better.</p>
<p>We then plugged back in to the management discussion and whether or not the agile community left middle management behind. The overall agile message can be overwhelming to management, but there is still a place for managers that we need to work on communicating in a more effective way.</p>
<p>Ryan proved incapable of saying Amitai’s name (AH-MEE-TY), we added more titles to Don’s book club, and then called it night.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I&#8217;m excited to share episode one of the &#8220;Agile for Humans&#8221; podcast. This is a regular podcast hosted by a rotating group of agilists who take on various topics and issues. I&#8217;m working on getting a site setup for the podcast, but for now you can find the episodes here and eventually on iTunes.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>On our inaugural episode the team started off by trying to name this new podcast, however, they eventually moved on. First we discussed Hala Saleh’s talk at Agile Indy 2015 title: My Agile is Better Than Your Agile. Overall the group agreed that empathy and kindness are key ingredients when talking about agile topics.</p>
<p>Next the team moved on to the caring and feeding of user groups. Aaron and Mark shared their experiences in this area and provided cautionary tales and solid advice to Ryan, who is looking to start and agile user group in Fort Wayne, IN.</p>
<p>Ryan discussed his recent talk at Agile Indy 2015 &#8211; Help!!! The Scrum Master IS the Impediment &#8211; and talked about the need for scrum masters to inspect and adapt their behaviors to avoid becoming impediments to their team’s success.</p>
<p>The team wrapped up with a some light talk about “change” and decided to table that large discussion for next time. Ryan completely butchered the word “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin">cynefin</a>”, Don started a book club, and then we called it a night</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week I'm excited to share episode one of the "Agile for Humans" podcast. This is a regular podcast hosted by a rotating group of agilists who take on various topics and issues. I'm working on getting a site setup for the podcast, but for now you can find the episodes here and eventually on iTunes.
Hosts
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donaldegray" target="_blank"&gt;Don Gray, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mkilby" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Kilby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aakopel" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Kopel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanripley" target="_blank"&gt;Ryan Ripley&lt;/a&gt;
Discussion
On our inaugural episode the team started off by trying to name this new podcast, however, they eventually moved on. First we discussed Hala Saleh’s talk at Agile Indy 2015 title: My Agile is Better Than Your Agile. Overall the group agreed that empathy and kindness are key ingredients when talking about agile topics.

Next the team moved on to the caring and feeding of user groups. Aaron and Mark shared their experiences in this area and provided cautionary tales and solid advice to Ryan, who is looking to start and agile user group in Fort Wayne, IN.

Ryan discussed his recent talk at Agile Indy 2015 - Help!!! The Scrum Master IS the Impediment - and talked about the need for scrum masters to inspect and adapt their behaviors to avoid becoming impediments to their team’s success.

The team wrapped up with a some light talk about “change” and decided to table that large discussion for next time. Ryan completely butchered the word “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin"&gt;cynefin&lt;/a&gt;”, Don started a book club, and then we called it a night

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Agile community in Indianapolis is a vibrant and flourishing group of passionate agilists and lean thinkers. They put together an amazing conference that should be on your radar for next year.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="571" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AgileIndy2015Hala-760x571.png" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Agile Indy 2015 - Hala Saleh Stage Talk" title="Agile Indy 2015 - Hala Saleh Stage Talk" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Agile Indy 2015 &#8211; Hala Saleh Stage Talk</div>
<p>The highlight of the event for me was <a href="https://twitter.com/HalaSaleh1" target="_blank">Hala Saleh&#8217;s</a> stage talk: &#8220;<a href="http://www.halasaleh.com/blog/2015/1/27/my-agile-is-better-than-your-agile" target="_blank">My Agile is Better Than Your Agile</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>She spoke about the dangers of extremism when promoting ideas. She also made a great case for dropping the judgment and negative connotations that come along with certain &#8220;trigger&#8221; words in the agile community such as: agile project manager, PMP, #NoEstimates, management, and PM&#8217;s.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We state &#8220;People over Process&#8221;, then turn around and put people in boxes because they have the wrong letters following their name, or because they use the word &#8220;hybrid&#8221;. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a message that I needed to hear and that I very much appreciated. It&#8217;s inspired me to inspect the way that I engage with others and adapt where needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://agileindy.org" target="_blank">Agile Indy 2015</a> was also a special event for me professionally. I presented a talk for the first time to the sell out crowd, and had a great time in the process.</p>
<p>I should have been nervous, but the excellent staff of conference volunteers, the venue, and the overall vibe of the event made it a great place to debut my talk:  <strong>Help!!! The Scrum Master *IS* the Impediment!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The change in mindset necessary to become a servant leader is incredibly hard for a scrum master who comes from command and control background. As a newly minted Professional Scrum Master (PSM I), I returned to my team excited and ready to get underway with a scrum adoption. Unfortunately, I had not fully grasped the concept of servant leadership. Instead of being a change agent, I was an impediment.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I also really appreciated one of the nicest &#8211; and most humbling &#8211; compliments that hit my Twitter feed immediately after the talk.</p>

<p>Comments like this are why I enjoy writing, blogging, and speaking. Becoming a scrum master is a difficult journey. <strong>I struggled with it.</strong> Given the feedback I&#8217;ve been getting, so have many other people.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scrum teams work on complex problems. Solutions emerge during these type of projects; over time and after many sprints. When a scrum master becomes the “hero” and mandates solutions, he/she can cause lasting damage to the scrum team.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="505" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Uplifting-Hero-JD-Hancock-Flickr-760x505.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Scrum Master Heroics" title="Scrum Master Heroics" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Uplifting Hero &#8211; JD Hancock &#8211; Flickr</div>
<p>All nighters, caffeine fueled coding marathons, and last minute deployment heroics happen regularly on projects death marching to a forced conclusion. That behavior manifests on agile teams as well. But the “hero scrum master” anti-pattern surprised me during a recent exchange on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>A scrum master explained his role as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would prefer to be considered as someone who managed to make the team get past the hurdles and obstacles and make it to the “Miller Time” to chuckle and laugh about how silly they behaved in reflection.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Not exactly the model statement for self-organization and self-management.</p>
<p>My own struggles with dropping the command and control habit are <a title="The Transition from Project Manager to Scrum Master is Hard" href="http://agileanswerman.com/the-transition-from-project-manager-to-scrum-master-is-hard/">here</a> and <a title="HELP!!! The Scrum Master IS the Impediment!" href="http://agileanswerman.com/help-the-scrum-master-is-the-impediment/">here</a>. During those episodes I thought I acted in the best interest of the team and with best intentions. And I believe that this scrum master feels the same about his actions.</p>
<p>With that said, the consequences of directing instead of coaching can be significant and long lasting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Ability to Experiment:</strong> When a scrum master “solves” all of the teams problems, the scrum team will not learn how to experiment. We constantly inspect and adapt our practices. Some changes work; others don’t. Dictating answers robs the team of these possible improvements and lessons.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Team Members Withdraw:</strong> Apathy sets in when scrum masters mandate solutions. A disengaged team can lead to silos of knowledge and individual actors as opposed to a gelled and cohesive scrum team.</li>
<li><strong>Whole Team Concept Compromised:</strong> Every member of the scrum team contributes to and owns the project. If a hero scrum master is solving all of the problems, the scrum team can become dependent on this hero behavior. Coaching others to solve issues and impediments can help make sure that teams grow, mature, and find success together.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT CAUSES HEROIC SCRUM MASTER BEHAVIOR?</strong></p>
<p>As the LinkedIn exchange progressed, it became clear that a bad system/environment drove the scrum master’s behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job Security:</strong> When I asked why the heroics were needed, he replied “<em>Either one is a passionately participating and involved scrum master or he is someone that can be replaced tomorrow and no one may notice any difference.</em>” Understandable, but not in the spirit of servant leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Carrot and Stick Mentality:</strong> He also added, “<em>Sounds to me more like letting people succeed or fail but suffer so they can change out of necessity at the cost of damaging the team&#8217;s image/pride and team spirit. This to me is something a villain would resort to.</em>” Experiments do not appear to be valued at his company. Neither does failure.</li>
<li><strong>Bad Scrum:</strong> The scrum master’s environment “smelled” toxic. The scrum team does not have a Product Owner. The QA team works in India and gets code nightly from U.S. based developers. The list goes on. Perhaps, without the heroics of the scrum master, nothing truly would get done at his company.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scrum master heroics can appear to help in the short term, but over time the negative impacts &#8211; especially the loss of continuous improvement &#8211; amplify. The sprint retrospective can help uncover these issues. But once these items make the impediment list, the scrum master still has the difficult task of addressing these system issues up the organizational structure.</p>
<p>Being a servant leader is hard, but as the consequences above indicate, we should coach our teams to be empowered and self-sufficient and remove system impediments…even if it makes us a bit uncomfortable.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number one question that I get from managers who are learning about Scrum and Agile is: <strong>What do I control on an Agile Project?</strong></p>
<p><img width="760" height="505" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Flight-Controls-Bryan-Burke-Flickr-760x505.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Flight Controls - Bryan Burke - Flickr" title="Flight Controls - Bryan Burke - Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Flight Controls &#8211; Bryan Burke &#8211; Flickr</div>
<p>It seems like a simple question to answer, but if you go the purist route and deep dive in to your self-managing teams talk, you risk alienating the manager. After a few failed attempts at answering this question, I think I’ve found a better way to address this very real management concern.</p>
<p>This question usually comes up when I start talking about how agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. Managers like the prioritized backlogs and the value tracking. Those things can be turned in to forecasts and metrics that map to their past experiences.</p>
<p>Self-organization feels odd to them, but they seem to get it. Self-managing teams on the other hand can lead to this kind of reaction:</p>
<p><strong>“Wait, if teams self-manage, then…what do I control?”</strong></p>
<p>Doubling down on self-management theory has not worked for me in the past. I’ve also tried answering this question by pointing out moments during a sprint where a manager can help the scrum team inspect and adapt their practices and the increment of software, with mixed results. And honestly, this answer is begging for more trouble than it’s worth.</p>
<p>During my most recent encounter with this question I gave a different answer.</p>
<p><strong>A manager on an agile project controls empowerment, which drives how much and how fast value is delivered to an organization.</strong></p>
<p>Every design review meeting, status report, security assessment, dashboard, metric, and inquiry take time (capacity) away from the team. This is time that could be used to get a valuable feature to a “done” state and ready to be shipped at the end of the sprint. In other words, <strong>attempting to control the project delays value from being delivered</strong>.</p>
<p>The impacts of trying to control an agile project can even be quantified if needed. I like to <strong>add the mechanisms that managers use &#8211; additional status reports, design reviews, and excessive documentation &#8211; to the team’s definition of done</strong>.</p>
<p>This creates transparency with the product owner and ensures that the scrum team takes these activities in to account when estimating their work. Future sprints can be run without the overhead of the control mechanisms to determine any differences in velocity.</p>
<p>Honestly, these managers have never had control of their software development projects &#8211; regardless of the methodology used. At best they had an illusion of control. Project are made up of people, not status reports. You can try to convince, coerce, inspire, or lead, but in the end people are going to do things that you cannot predict. And there isn’t a metric, meeting, or dashboard that can change that fact.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former co-worker reached out to me and wanted to know how to pass <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments/PSM-I-Assessment" target="_blank">Scrum.org’s Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) assessment</a>. Below I describe my path to certification and how to get the most out of the PSM I assessment experience.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="588" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/psm1-760x588.png" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="PSM I Assessment Certificate | Scrum.Org" title="PSM I Assessment Certificate | Scrum.Org" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">PSM I Assessment Certificate | Scrum.Org</div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments/PSM-I-Assessment" target="_blank">PSM I assessment</a> is an 80 question examination with a 60-minute time box. The questions are a mix of multiple choice and true false. To pass you must score at minimum an 85%, which means you need to get 68 questions right or better to become certified.</p>
<p>Scrum.org made the interesting decision to not require a class in order to take their assessments. This means that anyone who wants to try to gain the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Certification-Lists?AssessmentName=PSM%20I">Professional Scrum Master I credential</a> only needs to pay the $150 fee and pass the exam.</p>
<p>There are many paths that people have taken to get a passing score. Here’s my path to obtaining this certification followed by the steps that I think are valuable to people trying to pass this assessment.</p>
<p>Before pursuing the scrum.org certification path I had been working in an agile way for the previous 10 years. I started as a java developer, later moved in to project management and finally people management.</p>
<p>Even with 10 years of experience with agile and scrum, I decided to take the scrum.org <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Courses/Professional-Scrum-Master" target="_blank">Professional Scrum Master course</a>. I am fortunate to live close to Professional Scrum Trainer <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_chuck" target="_blank">Dr. Chuck Suscheck</a> and got a lot out of his class and subsequent mentoring on scrum and agile.</p>
<p>His class is excellent and gives the participants a solid basis for understanding scrum and the practices that support delivering value to your organization. He starts with values and principles and takes a deep dive in to how scrum works and how to implement scrum in real world situations.</p>
<p>I took the exam a few days after the class and managed to pass with a good score.</p>
<p>Clearly, I recommend the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Courses/Professional-Scrum-Master" target="_blank">Professional Scrum Master</a> course. It’s a great opportunity to learn about scrum in a group setting. The learning that takes place is valuable not only for understanding scrum, but for also creating relationships with other agile practitioners.</p>
<p>However, the class is expensive (<strong>$1,200+)</strong> and as mentioned earlier, it is not required to get certified. For those of you who plan on taking the PSM I assessment without taking the class, these 4 practices will help make sure you are successful:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the Scrum Guide…Often:</strong>  I read the <a href="http://scrumguides.org" target="_blank">scrum guide</a> 2-3 times per week. This not only keeps the scrum framework fresh in my mind, I often find myself gaining new insights in to scrum the more I read about and inspect the roles, artifacts, and practices outlined in the scrum guide.</li>
<li><strong>Take the Open Assessment…Often:</strong>  I don’t recommend taking the PSM I assessment until you are consistently scoring 100% on the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Open-Assessments/Scrum-Open-Assessment" target="_blank">open assessment</a>. There is some overlap between questions on the PSM I assessment and the open assessment so you can get a few right answers for “free”. More importantly, the open assessment gives you a feel for how the real exam is administered.</li>
<li><strong>Favor Empowering the Team:</strong>  If you are unsure about an answer, try asking yourself which of the available options empower the team. Scrum calls for teams to self-organize and self-manage. Answers that violate these practices will likely not be right.</li>
<li><strong>Read and Understand the Agile Manifesto:</strong>  The values and principles of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a> are at the core of scrum. You must understand the manifesto to truly understand the “why” behind the scrum roles, artifacts, and practices.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish you luck as you prepare for the PSM I assessment. If you follow the advice I’ve laid out, you should have a great chance of understanding scrum at an intermediate level and passing the exam.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing how all of you do!</p>

<p><img width="760" height="507" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TheComputingScaleCo-KennyLouie-760x507.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="TheComputingScaleCo-KennyLouie-Flickr" title="TheComputingScaleCo-KennyLouie-Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">TheComputingScaleCo-KennyLouie-Flickr</div>
<p>This is has been my thought process on scaling agile for a while, but I’ve often struggled to fully articulate this idea. Then I saw Gunther Verheyen’s recent post – “<a href="http://guntherverheyen.com/2015/03/12/agile-and-scrum-actually/" target="_blank">Agile and Scrum, actually</a>”.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Agile and Scrum, actually <a href="http://t.co/a8UT6j91HB">http://t.co/a8UT6j91HB</a><br />
— Gunther Verheyen (@Ullizee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ullizee/status/576114396369264640">March 12, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As a side note, I’m a big fan of Gunther Verheyen. I’ve mentioned his excellent book – <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/pocketguide" target="_blank">Scrum: A Pocket Guide</a> &#8211; many times on this blog. I follow him on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Ullizee" target="_blank">@Ullizee</a>). And his latest series of “actually” scrum posts on <a href="http://guntherverheyen.com" target="_blank">his blog site</a> are fantastic.</p>
<p>Verheyen hit a beautiful note in the previously mentioned “actually” post that struck a chord with me.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Values and principles are agnostic of scale.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Awesome.</strong> He’s absolutely right. The scrum tactics, strategies, and practices are modified to align multiple teams working off of a single product backlog. But <strong>the principles and values stay the same and they apply the same way whether dealing with one team or many.</strong></p>
<p>When adopting agile, the question really becomes:  <strong>How do the values and principles impact our organization?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is important because when organizations try to “scale agile” they are really scaling their software development systems – their processes, structures, relationships, and practices used to deliver their products and services.</p>
<p>If they have not dealt with these impacts, their scaling efforts cannot possibly go well.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/" target="_blank">Scrum Guide</a> says that at the end of each sprint a “potentially shippable” increment of software should be delivered by the scrum team. But what happens when system dependencies and other release constraints make shipping impossible? Enter the “hardening sprint”.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="507" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/all-done-760x507.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="All done | Flickr.com" title="All done | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">All done | Flickr.com</div>
<p>A hardening sprint is a specialized sprint where scrum teams work on things such as: integration testing, performance tuning, security reviews, and localization.</p>
<p>It is not a catchall for new features, sloppy code, bug fixes, and other work that signals poor craftsmanship. Be on alert for some of these common misuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>We ran out of time and didn’t full test this feature, <strong>we’ll finish testing during the hardening sprint</strong></li>
<li>User documentation didn’t quite get done for this feature. <strong>I’ll finish that up during the hardening sprint</strong></li>
<li>No need to engage support | security | infrastructure now, <strong>we’ll bring them up to speed during the hardening sprint</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These abuses are why many of the scrum gurus will tell you that hardening sprints are an “<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/scrumalliance/_huCoEZBSZg" target="_blank">anti-pattern</a>” or just flat out bad. A quick google search reveals past flame wars and pointed blog post demeaning the use of hardening sprints. This volatile territory. You’ve been warned.</p>
<p>However, I do not agree that scrum teams who use hardening sprints have <a href="http://scrumbutt.me/" target="_blank">lost their way</a>.</p>
<p>It is true that by using a hardening sprint, the scrum team is admitting that they did not deliver “done” software during their preceding sprints. This is an indication that their definition of done is lacking. This could be an impediment to the team’s future success.</p>
<p>But this could also be an intentional decision by the organization. <strong>A pristine definition of done is expensive.</strong> Continuous integration, high test coverage, and strong devops organizations take time to build and implement. Along with a lot of money. During the early stages of an agile transformation, hardening sprints may be mandatory due to some or all of these practices not being in place. This is ok, but please keep these 3 important ideas in mind when deciding to use a hardening sprint:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be transparent with the Product Owner about what “done” means:</strong>  If &#8220;done&#8221; isn&#8217;t true until after the hardening sprint, the Product Owner has the right to know. Being open about why the hardening sprint is necessary will allow the PO to make better decisions about releases and ensure that their forecasts and product planning are more meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t abuse the practice:</strong>  A hardening sprint isn&#8217;t a free pass to be lazy. Keep the work within the hardening sprint to a minimum and continually be on the lookout to reduce the work that is necessary to complete in hardening sprints.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the reliance on hardening sprints over time: </strong> Your goal should be to eventually eliminate the use of hardening sprints. In some organizations this will not be possible due to various constraints, however, continually inspecting the reason for sprints and looking for ways to reduce their frequency and duration can help the scrum team get value delivered faster to their customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bonus idea to wrap things up is to make sure that your decision to use a hardening sprint is <strong>intentional</strong>. By that I mean that scrum teams should have a plan for conducting hardening sprints and a long-term goal to eliminate them to the extent possible. If left to chance, many of the bad practice mentioned earlier can and will creep in to your hardening sprints.</p>
<div style="color:#006eb2"><strong><em><span class="preface">Question: </span>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on hardening sprints. Do you use them? If not, why not?

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A past co-worker reach out distressed about their Sprint Review meetings running amuck. Too many participants, topics, and tangents dropped the value of the meeting down to zero. Clearly, the Scrum Master must get the meeting refocused, but what’s the best way to do that?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="542" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/National-Library-of-Ireland-Flickr-760x542.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="National Library of Ireland - Flickr" title="National Library of Ireland - Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">National Library of Ireland &#8211; Flickr</div>
<p>This team operates in a plan, build, and run model. In other words, there are people responsible for planning, people responsible for development, and people responsible for support. A problem with this model is the cost of transitioning work between the 3 teams.</p>
<p>In an attempt to lower the cost of the handoff, the build team (scrum team) decided to incorporate the transfer to the support team (run) during their Sprint Review meeting.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the participants in the Sprint Review meeting increased and the build team now struggles to complete the support transition in the 4 hour time box (4 week Sprints), let alone the actual activities that are supposed to be completed during a Sprint Review meeting.</p>
<p>From the <a href="SCRUM%20GUIDE: http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review" target="_blank">Scrum Guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that the build team is not properly reviewing the current increment of software. They are not adjusting the product backlog to optimize the potential value of the next Sprint. And they are not collaborating with the product owner to get aligned for the next Sprint Planning session.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the build team should add transitioning support of the new feature/story/bug fix to their Definition of Done. There are 3 clear benefits to moving the cost of this activity from the Sprint Review Meeting to the overall Sprint.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Impact of the requirement will show in the team’s velocity.</strong> The build team should estimate their work knowing that transitioning the feature to the support team is part of the effort. This ensure that the cost of the process is known and can be discussed in real terms.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of the requirement will show in the value delivered.</strong> Similar to the value benefit, knowing the impact to amount of value a team can deliver in a sprint is another metric that can help guide better decision making and operational practices.</li>
<li><strong>The value of the requirement can be discussed in terms of impact to the organization.</strong> Having metrics replaces emotional conversations. Rather than argue that a transition meeting has zero value, the team can discuss the merits of the system in terms of value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps most important of all is that the build team gets their Sprint Review meeting back. This meeting is critical for getting the team ready for the next Sprint and to ensure that product backlog is optimized and ready to be used in the next Sprint Planning meeting.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/" target="_blank">Scrum Guide</a> tells us what a “sprint” is and gives best practices around duration and timing, but it says nothing about why scrum teams call iterations “sprints” in the first place.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="510" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/phgaillard2001-le-depart-flickr-760x510.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="phgaillard2001 | le depart | flickr" title="phgaillard2001 | le depart | flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">phgaillard2001 | le depart | flickr</div>
<p>This question actually came from a podcast that I listen to called <a href="http://www.thisagilelife.com/" target="_blank"><em>This Agile Life</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/johnsextro" target="_blank">John Sextro</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/craigbuchek" target="_blank">Craig Buchek</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/adkron" target="_blank">Amos King</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/theagilefactor" target="_blank">Jason Tice</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/agileatheist" target="_blank">Lee McCauley</a> publish this weekly podcast about life as agile coaches and developers.</p>
<p>On <em>This Agile Life</em> episode <a href="http://www.thisagilelife.com/64/" target="_blank">#64</a>, the topic was Giles Bowkett’s blog post &#8211; <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html" target="_blank">How Scrum Should Just Basically Die in a Fire</a>. I recently blogged about this same post, but did not comment on Mr. Bowkett’s disagreement with Scrum calling agile iterations “sprints”:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html" target="_blank">Scrum&#8217;s an agile development methodology, and one of its major goals is sustainable development. However, it works by time-boxing efforts into iterations of a week or two in length, and refers to these iterations as &#8220;sprints.&#8221; Time-boxed iterations are very useful, but there&#8217;s a fundamental cognitive dissonance between &#8220;sprints&#8221; and &#8220;sustainable development,&#8221; because there is no such thing as a sustainable sprint.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thisagilelife.com/" target="_blank"><em>This Agile Life</em></a> crew zeroed in on this criticism and mused about asking Jeff Sutherland why he decided to call scrum iterations “sprints”. Fortunately, Mr. Sutherland has a new book out called <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/sutherland" target="_blank">Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</a> AND he answered this question:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://agileanswerman.com/sutherland" target="_blank">And so my team embarked on what we called “sprints”. We called them that because the name evoked a quality of intensity. We were going to work all out for a short period of time and stop to see where we were.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With the origin story in mind, the “sprint” label makes sense for scrum teams:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The goal is intensity:</strong>  Scrum teams are laser focused on a sprint goal and work diligently on their sprint backlog items to turn their stories in to working software.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum teams take time to catch their breath:</strong> At the end of each sprint is a sprint review meeting. During the sprint review meeting, scrum teams stop to examine the sprint activities, the latest increment of software the team delivered, and the product backlog. The scrum team also conducts a sprint retrospective to examine how the team got to where they are and how they can do things better during the next sprint.</li>
<li><strong>Sprints are short for a reason:</strong> Mr. Bowkett is correct when he says that there is no such thing as a sustainable sprint. But short (2-4 week) sprints with time taken to inspect and adapt the work IS sustainable. Not stopping at the end of the time box jeopardizes sustainable pace as does going past the 1 month maximum sprint length.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inspecting scrum is a great way to become a better agile practitioner. Podcasts like <a href="http://www.thisagilelife.com/" target="_blank"><em>This Agile Life</em></a> and blogs like Mr. Bowkett’s are great places to help you think about scrum and deepen your understanding about the practices that you use every day. <a title="5 Ways to Improve Your Scrum Game" href="http://agileanswerman.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-scrum-game/" target="_blank">It’s a tip that I’ve given in the past</a>, but I cannot stress it enough as a great way to improve.</p>
<p>In this case, we learned that the label &#8220;sprint&#8221; is meant to give teams a sense of urgency, but with the intention of taking rest after the intense work it takes to turn sprint backlog items in to increments of software.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month Giles Bowkett wrote a scathing blog post about scrum called: <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html" target="_blank">Why Scrum Should Basically Just Die in a Fire</a>. It’s a provocative article that shows how damaging bad agile and scrum can be to a team.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MsGlaze-Fire-Flickr-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Ms. Glaze | Flame | Flickr" title="Ms. Glaze | Flame | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Ms. Glaze | Flame | Flickr</div>
<p>I’m not going to go point by point and argue with Mr. Bowkett about his experiences with scrum. They are his experiences, and they are truly awful. I have sympathy for him and those who have been burned by a botched agile transformation.</p>
<p>With waterfall, teams know what they are signing up for at the start of a project. They know there will be problems and that a death march is likely. They also know that the date set at the beginning of the project is likely wrong, but still they soldier on.</p>
<p>But with agile and scrum it’s supposed to be different. The <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a> is a developer play aimed at making the lives of engineers better. Scrum specifically puts the team in control of how they accomplish their work. Everything should be great.</p>
<p><strong>But often, it isn’t.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Bowkett makes this point by calling out many common scrum anti-patterns that he has experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="[QUESTION] Why Do Scrum Teams Estimate in Story Points Instead of Hours?" href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-why-do-scrum-teams-estimate-in-story-points-instead-of-hours/" target="_blank">Planning poker not being played correctly</a></li>
<li><a title="The Transition from Project Manager to Scrum Master is Hard" href="http://agileanswerman.com/the-transition-from-project-manager-to-scrum-master-is-hard/" target="_blank">Scrum master’s behaving badly</a></li>
<li>Never ending standup meetings / daily scrums</li>
<li><a title="[QUESTION] Can a Scrum Master Force an Increase in Velocity?" href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-can-a-scrum-master-force-an-increase-in-velocity/" target="_blank">Velocity abuse</a> – <a title="Scrum: Velocity Measures Story Points, Not Productivity" href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-velocity-measures-story-points-not-productivity/" target="_blank">story point gaming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all valid &#8211; and unfortunately common &#8211; problems on scrum teams. However, the conclusion that he draws from the existence of these problems misses the mark.</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, in its best-case scenario, Scrum&#8217;s a dog-and-pony show. But that best-case scenario is rare. In the much more common case, Scrum covers up the inability to recruit (or even recognize) engineering talent, which is currently one of the most valuable things in the world, with a process for managing engineers as if they were cogs in a machine, all of equal value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than cover up individual inabilities, <strong>scrum exposes the bad practices of organizations</strong>. <em>Quickly</em>. Work becomes transparent, impediments become obvious, and old practices become extra painful.</p>
<p>The culprit here are manager who thought they were getting hyper-productivity for free. They want the benefits of scrum, without having to change.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Bowkett’s problem is with lousy managers, not scrum.</strong></p>
<p>The agile community is also partially to blame. The tendency is to focus coaching and training on the scrum team. But it is the management team members that we need to be working on the most. Bad scrum cannot take root in an organization that embraces the scrum values from the top down.</p>
<p>Part of embracing the scrum values is accepting the twelve principles of agile from the agile manifesto, which Mr. Bowkett also railed against.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think highly of Scrum, but the problem here goes deeper. The Agile Manifesto is flawed too. Consider this core principle of Agile development: &#8220;business people and developers must work together.&#8221; Why are we supposed to think developers are not business people?</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re not. The intent of this agile principle is the end the “<em>us vs them</em>” mentality between IT and “the business”. With Scrum, the expectation is that the product owner is co-located with the development team and available to answer questions about the product backlog items.</p>
<p>This isn’t a slight against the business acumen of developers. It’s a call for close collaboration between stakeholders and engineers. How else can the development team know if they are working on the most valuable features for the business?</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the closing circle of <a href="http://blog.agilecoachcamp.us" target="_blank">Agile Coach Camp 2014</a> our facilitator – <a href="http://abiggerga.me/" target="_blank">Deb Hartmann Preuss</a> – asked us: Which word described our experiences during the conference? The word that immediately came to mind was “humbling”.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="570" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CShareFlickr-760x570.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="CS | Share | Flickr.com" title="CS | Share | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">CS | Share | Flickr.com</div>
<p>Agile Coach Camp is an open space event. It’s an “unconference” where agile coaches network and develop relationships while inventing ideas, concepts and practices. The attendees come up with high-level topics and create their own conference agenda – better known as the marketplace.</p>
<p>They then gather around the topics that interest them and collaborate, plan, discuss, and dig deeper as a group to develop new “things”. You can fine more information about the open space concept <a href="http://www.agileopen.net/on-open-space" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the interesting parts about this format is that the presenter is actually a facilitator. They are responsible for proposing a problem or an idea, but after that the session turns in to a dynamic group discussion.</p>
<p>At this year’s Agile Coach Camp, some of the biggest names in the industry showed up. People like <a href="http://futureworksconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Diana Larsen</a>, <a href="http://www.estherderby.com/" target="_blank">Esther Derby</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/donaldegray" target="_blank">Don Gray</a>, <a href="http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/" target="_blank">George Dinwiddie</a>, and <a href="http://agileotter.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tim Ottinger </a>facilitated and presented alongside the other 90 participants.</p>
<p>While it was humbling, it was also amazing. Getting to exchange ideas with some of the best coaches in the industry was tremendous fun. That kind of interaction is simply not possible at the larger conferences. It is a level of sharing that I’ve never seen in a community.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the topics we discussed would not have made it in to the agenda of a traditional conference. Those events are filled with talks on metrics, agile tools, and scaling scrum.</p>
<p>At Agile Coach Camp, the focus is squarely on <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">individuals and interactions and not process and tools</a>.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of this, here are some of the sessions that I attended:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agile Game Mechanics</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/paul_boos" target="_blank">@paul_boos</a>): A discussion on how traditional game mechanics &#8211; random event decks, dice rolling, character creation, quest mechanics, and action points – can be used to develop agile games and simulations.</li>
<li><strong>Conjoint Coaching</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie" target="_blank">@gdinwiddie</a>): Coaching teams as a whole and how to model behavior. Also a great discussion on observing teams and feedback loops to get to the core of what drives the way people interact on an agile team.</li>
<li><strong>Thinking for a Living</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/tottinge" target="_blank">@tottinge</a>): The challenges of breaking away from the factory mindset in an age where your job is to think, not assemble. We looked at how the brain works, how naps make people more productive, and even the best time to have a parole hearing (ego depletion example).</li>
<li><strong>BA’s Role on an Agile Team</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/AgileSquirrel" target="_blank">@agilesquirrel</a>): Where does a BA fit on an agile team? Should they be a scrum master or a product owner? Is “business analyst” a valid agile role? These questions and how to avoid a squirrel attack were covered in detail.</li>
<li><strong>Agile Coaching is Dead</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/howardsublett" target="_blank">@howardsublett</a>): An incredibly honest discussion about whether or not agile coaching is a bubble ready to burst. We also dove in to the role that certification bodies play in the impending demise of the agile coach, along with what agile coaches can do to change direction and bring value to their customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outcomes of these talks led to what many of us called “ideas too big to tweet”. The conversations were rich and we all walked away with new ideas and more importantly new friends.</p>
<p>This is now my favorite “unconference” that I will keep on my schedule for years to come. Next year Agile Coach Camp is in DC. I hope to see you there.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of following the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935589679/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1935589679&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=agileanswer-20&amp;linkId=CDIUQ3ZDONJO6FKU" target="_blank">PMBOK</a> and delivering projects using traditional project management methods (waterfall) your organization has decided to try out scrum. What are you in for and how much is it going to hurt?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Business-Man-1-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Business Man |Flicker" title="Business Man |Flicker" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Business Man |Flicker</div>
<p>The short answer is:  <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>
<p>I once attended a one day workshop on scrum led by <a href="http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ken Schwaber</a> and a few other instructors as part of a Microsoft ALM conference. It was a great experience that made an impression on me.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day, I asked one of the instructors which role a project manager should ideally transition to during an agile adoption. Many in the room were expecting to hear an answer of scrum master or maybe even product owner.</p>
<p>Instead he replied, “<em><strong>Perhaps a project manager could test code…but even that’s unlikely.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>I was not surprised.</p>
<p>Having lived through the change from project manager to scrum master I understood the answer. Look, I know this is not what people want to hear, but it is very difficult to make the switch from a traditional project manager to a scrum master.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/help-the-scrum-master-is-the-impediment/" target="_blank">my struggles with giving up the command and control mindset</a>. The pitfalls during this type of transition are many and you &#8211; as a newly minted scrum master &#8211; are giving up many of the tools and techniques that brought you success in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it’s abusive to force traditional – PMP certified – project managers become scrum masters. The <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/kindness-is-the-missing-agile-value/" target="_blank">skills and mindsets are wildly different </a>between the two roles.</p>
<p>For those willing take the leap and learn something new, I’ve come up with 3 thoughts to help you along when things get tricky:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-master-is-a-title-servant-leadership-is-a-mindset/" target="_blank">Servant leadership</a> is all about enabling autonomy:</strong>  As a scrum master your highest goal is to foster a self-directing team. You are empowering people to make decisions about how their work gets done and thereby am creating the conditions necessary for people to do their best work. <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/drive" target="_blank">Daniel Pink’s “Drive” </a>is a great place to start to learn more about this concept.</li>
<li><strong>Promote the whole team concept whenever possible:</strong>  The last thing you want to do as a scrum master is single someone out on the team. Your goal is to instill the mentality of “we are all in this together” whenever possible. Protect the team from outside influences and help them all row in the same direction.</li>
<li><strong>When in doubt, ASK THE TEAM: </strong> You are no longer the smartest person in the room. Actually, you never were. Sorry. The team is smarter than any one person and is capable of figuring out incredibly complex things together. Not sure what to do next? Ask the team AND wait for an answer. Someone will eventually speak and a great conversation could follow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, command and control is out the window. Scrum masters <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-can-a-scrum-master-force-an-increase-in-velocity/" target="_blank">do not dictate how much work the team does</a>. They also <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-what-should-a-scrum-master-do-when-a-team-member-is-not-performing/" target="_blank">do not have direct authority over the scrum team members</a>. But these are the tendencies that traditional project managers will have to fight against as they learn how to be a scrum master.</p>
<p>We learn scrum iteratively. <strong>My bonus tip is to practice introspection.</strong> After a difficult team meeting or a situation that you feel you could have handled better, take the time to think about how you will change things for next time. Becoming aware of your tendencies and behaviors is the only way to correct them and move forward.</p>
<p>A book to help you become a great scrum master is Geoff Watts book, <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrummastery" target="_blank">Scrum Mastery: From Good to Great Servant Leadership</a>. This is the guide to getting in to the mind of scrum master. My copy has copious notes and quite a few highlighter marks. Highly recommended!</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where waterfall projects went wrong is where <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">agile principles</a> were born. The war room – gathering the team in one location for a short burst of effort &#8211; is a perfect example of this concept.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="427" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/camknows-War-Room-Flickr-760x427.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="camknows | War Room | Flickr" title="camknows | War Room | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">camknows | War Room | Flickr</div>
<p>I remember early in my career working on a distributed team. My team was on the east coast while a fellow developer led a team on the west coast. We were struggling with getting both teams in sync on how to use the latest internal API’s.</p>
<p>Code was changing rapidly and the written word didn’t have the bandwidth to keep up. Instant messenger worked ok, and emails got some of the points across. But there was still a major gap in communication.</p>
<p>Finally, after way too many late nights of spinning our wheels, I stormed in to the CEO’s office and asked, “Can we just fly out to the west coast for a few weeks and get this figured out?”</p>
<p>Surprisingly he said, “Go.”</p>
<p>Once the teams were together, we immediately setup a “war room” and got to work. It took a few weeks, but having the team together in the same room made a significant impact on our progress. I think 3 key things changed once we were together that helped us past our issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feedback was immediate: </strong> The teams were pair programming and peer reviewing features as they were written. Anyone on the team could see or hear what was going on and could interject as needed. No lost emails or missed chat messages to hold us up.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations gained context: </strong> Instead of suffering through the limits of 300 word emails, people could collaborate. The combined team organized in to groups based on the current user story and got to work. Questions were answered and whiteboards were used to clear up any misunderstandings. No mass email could possibly compete with these results.</li>
<li><strong>Face time made a difference:</strong> Non-verbal communication IS communication. Your face often says more than your words. So can your body language. These cues enrich the dialogue and help foster stronger relationships and trust between team members. An emoticon in an email just doesn’t cut it compared to a real smile. <img src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, the co-location of the team for a short time made a major impact on the project. While we were able to carry some of the momentum of that trip in to future releases, we were never as effective apart as we were together.</p>
<p>Back to the question that this post posed:  Do scrum teams need to be collocated? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the end of the world if you are on a distributed team. Being aware of the moments where face to face meetings are necessary is critical to success. Other tools like webcams can also help. But you are leaving team capacity and trust on the table when you have distributed teams.</p>
<p>My preference is a scrum team in one location.</p>
<div style="color:#006eb2"><strong><em><span class="preface">Question: </span>That is one of my more intense experiences about what happens when a team is not co-located and the project goes bad. What have you seen on your teams?

<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Steve-Rideout-Group-Hug-Flickr-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Steve Rideout | Group Hug | Flickr" title="Steve Rideout | Group Hug | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Steve Rideout | Group Hug | Flickr</div>
<p>In the midst of an agile transformation, a project manager asked to join me for lunch. We sat down and I immediately sensed that she had some questions about scrum. I was the only Scrum Master at the company and she needed help.</p>
<p>She asked about hybrid models and if scrum and waterfall can co-exist. Rather than use these questions as an opportunity to understand her worries and fears about the move to scrum, I went on a rant against waterfall. Why would anyone want to keep waterfall practices, they’re what lead to failure, right?</p>
<p>My colleague smiled, finished her lunch and politely left the room. I blew it. Later I realized that she wasn’t defending waterfall. The idea of moving to scrum terrified her. She was very successful as a traditional PM and was uneasy about the upcoming change.</p>
<p>I did nothing to help her.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://agileanswerman.com/kindness-is-the-missing-agile-value/" target="_blank">I wasn’t kind</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I talked to this project manager a few days later and we ended up having a great discussion about agile. But my initial mistake stayed with me. I think there is more here than just a mishandled discussion.</p>
<p>I realized that agile transformations scare people…a lot.</p>
<h1>Scrum Adoption Personas</h1>
<p>When a scrum team talks about story cards, they sometimes use personas. A persona is an example of the type of person or role that would use an application. Personas are also at play when an organization decides to adopt scrum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian the manager is still a number of years away from retirement, but is now worried that self-organizing teams means that his role as a leader will be diminished.</li>
<li>Bob the programmer loves being the hero coder, but realized that due to team ownership of tasks and code that his style will no longer fit well on a scrum team.</li>
<li>Lenny the tester has heard that scrum and extreme programming (XP) incorporates testing in to the development process and now worries that he is out of a job.</li>
<li>Bruce the business director loves Gantt charts and project plans during status meetings, but has heard that he won’t get these project artifacts anymore. He’s worried about how the team will deliver without a documented plan.</li>
<li>Jenny the project manager who went to a scrum master class and was told by the teacher that there is not a project manager role on a scrum team and that PM’s don’t typically make it through agile transformations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your team size, there are many more of these personas in your organization. And they are acting against your agile transformation.</p>
<p>Once we know the personas at play, we &#8211; as agile coaches &#8211; must be encouraging. What does that look like? Let’s go back to the story that I opened with.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to correct my co-worker, I should have been more encouraging. Listening to her concerns should have been my priority. This is a far better approach than lecturing someone.</p>
<p>I also should have helped her see how her PM skills and knowledge of the organization could translate to a Scrum Master role with a<a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-master-is-a-title-servant-leadership-is-a-mindset/" target="_blank"> change in mindset and practices</a>. That is encouragement. It’s a boost to a person who is afraid of what’s coming.</p>
<p>To me this approach encapsulates the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">agile value of individuals and interactions over process and tools</a>.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a person believes that carrots and sticks lead to productivity, no 2-day class and a certificate on the wall can change that. But those who seek to empower people and teams can become great scrum masters and servant leaders.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="427" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Teamwork-Image-760x427.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Unknown | Team | Flickr" title="Unknown | Team | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Unknown | Team | Flickr</div>
<p>In the comments section of my post “<a title="HELP!!! The Scrum Master IS the Impediment!" href="http://agileanswerman.com/help-the-scrum-master-is-the-impediment/" target="_blank">Help! The Scrum Master is the Impediment</a>”, Darko asked that I cover servant leadership. Darko seems to also have experience with a scrum master who does not behave well and asked some great questions about the role:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a servant leader?</li>
<li>How does a scrum master serve their team as opposed to directing it?</li>
<li>Where in practice does the scrum master meet their servant role – can you give concrete examples?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is a servant leader?</strong></p>
<p>The term servant leader came about in an essay by <a href="http://www.greenleaf.org" target="_blank">Robert Greenleaf</a> title “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008K5IPB8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008K5IPB8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank">The Servant as Leader</a>”. In his essay, Greenleaf described a servant leader as “<em>one who makes sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served.</em>”</p>
<p>He offered these question as a litmus test to servant leadership:  “<em>Do those served grow as persons? Do they while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?</em>”</p>
<p><strong>How does a scrum master serve their team as opposed to directing it?</strong></p>
<p>The change in mindset necessary to become a servant leader is incredibly hard for a scrum master who comes from command and control background. There are a few changes in thinking that can help with this transition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favor self-organization:</strong>  Don’t make decisions for the team or assign their work, ask them how they will tackle the next sprint goal. And trust them to follow through.</li>
<li><strong>Enable self-management:</strong>   Scrum teams self-manage their work and their practices. Rather than dictate how the team will deliver value back to their business partners, work to remove the organizational barriers to their success.</li>
<li><strong>Let teams fail:</strong>  This is more difficult than it seems. Allowing a team to “fail” and learn important lesson that will pay off down the road is difficult. But sometimes it is necessary for the growth of the scrum team. When this does happen…</li>
<li><strong>Provide cover for your team:</strong>  Your company/organization/business will not initially understand how your scrum team works. Coach up through the management chain so that “failure” and other experiments by the scrum team are encouraged, not punished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Daniel Pink’s book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BR9S6CC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BR9S6CC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank">Drive</a>” gives insights in to what motivates people and is the best argument against command and control that I’ve ever read. This is the book that project managers making the transition to scrum master should read – and then apply the lessons to their scrum teams.</p>
<p><strong>Where in practice does the scrum master meet their servant role – can you give concrete examples?</strong></p>
<p>A servant leadership minded scrum master should be a servant to their team every day. By challenging the team with a probing question during a sprint retrospective or by recommending a  <a title="5 Reasons A Scrum Master Should Use Fist of Five Voting" href="http://agileanswerman.com/5-reasons-a-scrum-master-should-use-fist-of-five-voting/" target="_blank">fist of five</a> check to get everyone involved in a discussion, <strong>scrum masters are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to apply their servant role</strong>.</p>
<p>I remember a particular situation as a scrum master where I had to work with a design manager who was against scrum and agile. He insisted on design reviews prior to any code being written and would mandate technical solutions that the scrum team did not agree with.</p>
<p>I was obligated by my role to try to coach this person in order to make sure that the scrum team was empowered to manage their work – within the bounds of accepted corporate standards. The discussions were tense and difficult. <strong>But the team came first.</strong> Eventually, we were able to work out modified design rules for scrum teams and we went on to have many successful sprints.</p>
<p>Situations like that are risky. I was dealing with a member of the management team and had to walk a very fine line in order to help the scrum team and keep my job. <a href="http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ken Schwaber’s</a> warning was constantly on my mind: <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073561993X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=073561993X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank">A dead scrum master is a useless scrum master.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>But things did – and tend to – work out.</strong></p>
<p>Geoff Watts wrote and amazing book on scrum masters as servant leaders called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0957587406/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0957587406&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank">Scrum Mastery: From Good to Great Servant Leadership</a>”. He goes in to a lot more detail about the habits and behaviors of great scrum masters. It is an excellent resource for any scrum master looking to improve.</p>
<p>Thanks to Darko for asking the questions about servant leadership. I hope that I’ve shed some light on this important topic.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowing what you want to find before you start looking seems like common sense. Yet many agile and scrum teams blindly gather metrics without really knowing what they want to learn from the data.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="570" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Erika-Target-Flickr-Best-760x570.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Erika | Target | Flickr" title="Erika | Target | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Erika | Target | Flickr</div>
<p>The way that most scrum teams approach agile metrics reminds me of the exchange between Alice and The Cat in Lewis Carroll’s classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1499568886/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1499568886&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank">Alice in Wonderland</a>.</p>
<p>In this scene, Alice has come to a fork in the road and is unsure which way to go:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Alice:</strong> Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?<br />
<strong>The Cat:</strong> That depends a good deal on where you want to get to<br />
<strong>Alice:</strong> I don&#8217;t much care where.<br />
<strong>The Cat:</strong> Then it doesn&#8217;t much matter which way you go.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alice did not have a goal in mind while she was traveling along the road, and neither do most scrum teams when they set out to capture agile metrics.</p>
<p>Scrum teams can quickly become enamored with the amount of data that can be collected during a sprint. Story points, velocity, cost per story, cost per story point, throughput, number of stories per sprint, escaped defects, team health, and customer satisfaction are just a few examples off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Give the wide range and complexity of agile metrics that we could capture, we should accept a simple truth about these calculations:</p>
<p><strong>The agile metrics that scrum teams collect are meaningless unless they are driven by a goal.</strong></p>
<p>Why do you track velocity sprint after sprint? Because a training class said to? Or because you <a title="Scrum: Velocity Measures Story Points, Not Productivity" href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-velocity-measures-story-points-not-productivity/" target="_blank">read about it in a blog post</a>? No way!</p>
<p>There should be a problem that the scrum team is seeking to either solve or understand with every agile metric that they are collecting. With velocity, a scrum team could be trying to gauge their sustainable pace. Or perhaps they want to provide a means to help the product owner with release planning.</p>
<p><strong>The actual goal is not as important as making sure that the team has one in the first place.</strong></p>
<p>During a particularly difficult sprint retrospective meeting, one of my scrum teams noticed that they were struggling to deliver all of the stories that they committed to during consecutive sprints.</p>
<p>After some discussion, the team decided to track estimated story points per sprint and velocity. The difference between the two numbers would be called “found work”.</p>
<p>The scrum team decided that the goal of tracking these agile metrics – and particularly “found work” &#8211; was to measure changes in effort over the course of a sprint. The team felt that effort increased over time, which cause them to miss their sprint goals.</p>
<p>After a few sprints, the scrum team learned that the estimated effort was significantly increasing. But the numbers cannot tell you where the problems actually are. The root cause could have been one of many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the scrum team was not properly grooming their product backlog items which led to “found work” during the sprint.</li>
<li>Maybe the scrum team’s definition of done was too stringent given their level of engineering practices which caused an increase in effort to deliver the stories included in the sprints.</li>
<li>It’s even possible that after digging deeper the scrum team learned that the relationship between the scrum product owner and the stakeholders was strained which led to poor communication and incomplete product stories.</li>
<li>Progressive elaboration could also have been taking place. The scrum team could simply be learning throughout the sprint and everything could be ok.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the goal of their agile metric work realized, the scrum team focused on the problem during their next sprint retrospective. They were able to realize the high &#8220;found work&#8221; metric meant that too many epics were being added to the sprint backlog.</p>
<p>Not grooming their stories and slicing them in to smaller pieces hid much of the complexity that the scrum team was agreeing to take on sprint after sprint.</p>
<p>This particular team added a “3 touch rule” for stories to their definition of done. In order for a story to be eligible to be added to a sprint backlog, it had to be groomed and estimated at least 3 times by the team. This change led to the scrum team being more consistent at hitting their sprint goals.</p>
<p>Metrics are alluring, but they can also be <a title="[QUESTION] Can a Scrum Master Force an Increase in Velocity?" href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-can-a-scrum-master-force-an-increase-in-velocity/" target="_blank">deceptive</a> and more importantly<a href="http://agileanswerman.com/no-estimates-does-not-stop-agile-metric-abuse/" target="_blank"> abused</a>. Scrum teams should be <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/5-agile-metrics-to-measure-high-performance-scrum-teams/" target="_blank">intentional about how they collect agile metrics</a>, the goal of the data, and what decisions will ultimately be made. Otherwise, why go to all the trouble of collecting the data in the first place?</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would you do if your Scrum Product Owner decided that customer value should be the sole focus of the scrum team and therefore wants to eliminate estimation (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash" target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a>) from the scrum development team’s process?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kerrin-Asmundson-Free-Estimates-Flickr-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Kerrin Asmundson | Free Estimates | Flickr" title="Kerrin Asmundson | Free Estimates | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Kerrin Asmundson | Free Estimates | Flickr</div>
<p>Perhaps the scrum product owner read the <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/no-estimates-does-not-stop-agile-metric-abuse" target="_blank">exchange between Neil Killick and me</a> and decided that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash" target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a> is the way to go. Is it possible that I failed to <a title="Scrum: Velocity Measures Story Points, Not Productivity" href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-velocity-measures-story-points-not-productivity/">express the benefits </a>that <a title="5 Agile Metrics to Help Scrum Teams Improve" href="http://agileanswerman.com/5-agile-metrics-to-measure-high-performance-scrum-teams/">estimates can bring</a>?</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>But in this case, the answer is pretty simple. As a scrum master I would remind the scrum product owner that he/she does not have control over the team’s practices or their estimates. There is a misconception in some organizations that a product owner is a “manager”.</p>
<p>This simply isn’t true.</p>
<p>The scrum product owner is responsible for optimizing the value of the scrum development team does. This is primarily achieved by providing a well refined and prioritized product backlog.</p>
<p>Scrum teams are self-managing and own their processes. The team is responsible for continually inspecting their practices and results – usually in a sprint retrospective – looking for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Following that explanation, I would then ask the team what they think about the scrum product owner’s request.</p>
<p>Scrum is a “developer play” after all. So it only makes sense to ask the team what value they see in estimating (or not estimating) their work.</p>
<p>If after such a discussion, the team decided to go the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash" target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a> route, I would fully support them.</p>
<p>There are some topics that the team would need to speak to with capacity being one of them. Forecasting for the product owner would be another. As long as the team as figures out how to meet these business expectations, then why not give <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates?src=hash" target="_blank">#NoEstimates </a>a shot? Scrum is based on empiricism. Inspect and adapt!</p>
<p>In this example, the scrum product owner decided that estimates are overhead. This sentiment is hard to disagree with. Estimates are pretty worthless. They expire quickly. When requirements change they expire even faster. Worse of all, estimates are almost always wrong.</p>
<p>But that is why scrum teams estimate often. We are not trying to hit a date or measure the accuracy of our estimates. Rather, scrum teams uses estimates to guide them on how much work they can complete in a sprint.</p>
<p>The estimates can also be used by the team to discover their sustainable pace and to forecast a few sprints out to see where stories (features) could be delivered. These activities have value to a scrum team and to the product owner during release planning activities.</p>
<p>But these benefits diminish if the estimates are not continually updated. During these multiple planning poker (estimation) sessions, the team learns quite a lot about the story in question and about each other. These interactions can lead to a much better team and product.</p>
<p>As a scrum master you should be looking for opportunities to empower your team to make their own decisions. In this case, the scrum product owner wanted to dictate how the team estimates (or doesn’t estimate) their work. Instead, the better approach is ask the team to discuss the idea and decide for themselves whether or not to give it a try.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates" target="_blank"><strong>#NoEstimates</strong></a> crowd wants the agile community to stop estimating stories on scrum projects. Their reasoning:  <strong>story points and velocity calculations are gamed and abused.</strong></p>
<p><img width="760" height="426" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Christina-Welsh-Metric-Flickr-760x426.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Christina Welsh | Metric | Flickr" title="Christina Welsh | Metric | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Christina Welsh | Metric | Flickr</div>
<p>And they are right. Management teams, scrum masters, and product owners abuse these numbers…often. But getting rid of agile estimation and a scrum team’s velocity calculations is not the solution.</p>
<p>In fact, you lose quite a few benefits that estimation brings to the scrum team:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conversations that arise from planning poker tends to smoke out hidden issues and drives whole team learning about the story being estimated.</li>
<li>A groomed and estimated product backlog gives a transparent view in to the work that the team is getting “done”.</li>
<li>The Product Owner has the ability to forecast product releases based on the velocity of the team – driven by the estimates.</li>
<li>The development team can use velocity and other agile metrics to drive continuous improvement and to help gauge what their sustainable pace is over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of the agile estimation process leads me to think the <strong>#NoEstimates</strong> group is chasing the wrong problem. Let’s looks at the reasons to ditch estimating story points and calculating velocity given by some of the more visible proponents of <strong>#NoEstimates</strong> practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estimation is difficult</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ron Jefferies:</strong>  <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/the-noestimates-movement/" target="_blank">“Estimates are difficult. When requirements are vague — and it seems that they always are — then the best conceivable estimates would also be very vague. Accurate estimation becomes essentially impossible.”</a></li>
<li><strong>Joshua Kerievsky:</strong> <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/" target="_blank">“Newbies are confused and uncomfortable estimating with story points and frequently compensate by consistently translating story points back to actual time estimates.”</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Estimates and velocity are misused:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ron Jefferies:</strong> <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/the-noestimates-movement/" target="_blank">“Estimates are often used as a bludgeon to try to get programmers to work faster. This leads to unhappy programmers and to poor software. No one wins.”</a></li>
<li><strong>Neil Killick:</strong> <a href="http://neilkillick.com/2013/11/24/context-is-no-longer-king/" target="_blank">“What I object to is being asked to carry out (or ask my team to carry out) estimation rituals whose results will then be used for making important business decisions.”</a></li>
<li><strong>Joshua Kerievsky:</strong> <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/" target="_blank">“I shook my head, amazed at how a mature agile team, a team that had been assessed, trained and coached by myself and two excellent Industrial Logic coaches, could so suddenly inflate their story point estimates to appear like they were going faster.”</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Scope of work = Commitments:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ron Jefferies:</strong> <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/the-noestimates-movement/" target="_blank">“In addition, a focus on estimation often leads to a fascination with completing some fixed scope of work.”</a></li>
<li><strong>Neil Killick:</strong> <a href="http://neilkillick.com/2012/04/12/do-not-estimate-software-projects-at-all/%20" target="_blank">“Fixed” scope project delivery expectations are often (always?) based on an up-front estimate of scope (guess) and how long that scope will take to be delivered (another guess), leading to the obvious dysfunctions like death-marches, low quality, etc.”</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Estimates are waste:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Woody Zuill:</strong> <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2013/01/25/if-you-found-estimates-bring-no-value-what-would-you-do/" target="_blank">“Dang right I’d eliminate them! Anything that is a cost that brings no value is WASTE and I would rather spend my money some better way. I won’t keep any process, practice, procedure, policy, or plan with no pay-off.”</a></li>
<li><strong>Neil Killick:</strong> <a href="http://neilkillick.com/2012/04/12/do-not-estimate-software-projects-at-all/%20" target="_blank">“To increase velocity the team simply needs to over-estimate stories to give the illusion of delivering more. They may not consciously do this but it may happen sub-consciously. The project manager pats them on the back, but all that has happened is the same amount of “done” working software has been delivered.”</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The charge filed against estimations and velocity are not new. I&#8217;ve covered the <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/question-can-a-scrum-master-force-an-increase-in-velocity/" target="_blank">abuses of velocity</a> and the <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-velocity-measures-story-points-not-productivity/" target="_blank">gaming of estimations</a> in past posts. Where I disagree with the #NoEstimations group is that the abuses are the fault of the metrics themselves. Estimates and velocity are just numbers.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is the conflict between traditional management and agile teams.</strong></p>
<p>In his recent blog post &#8211; <a href="http://rgalen.com/agile-training-news/2014/6/9/agile-coaches-were-coaching-the-wrong-people" target="_blank">Agile Coaches – We’re coaching the wrong people!?!?</a> – <a href="https://twitter.com/bobgalen" target="_blank">Bob Galen</a> cuts to the heart of the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Instead of taking the easy road (and money) by mostly training &amp; coaching teams, I’d like us to focus on partnering with and training the management tiers within organizations. In fact, I’m starting to think we’ve been avoiding these folks.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Picture a newly minted scrum master, the ink on their certification not even dry yet, marching in to a meeting with traditional managers and trying to explain how velocity is a team metric, not a management tool.</p>
<p><strong>The scrum master doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. </strong></p>
<p>Clearly, management are the very people that need to have a solid understanding of agile principles, practices and <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-values-can-make-or-break-your-agile-project/" target="_blank">values</a> if any meaningful organizational change is going to take place. <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/kindness-is-the-missing-agile-value/" target="_blank">And we have not helped them get there</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Galen touches on this as well.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As I reflect on my most successful coaching gigs, these ratios come through—in coaching, conversations, training, and simply influencing change. The middle management tier in organizations, comprised of team leads, managers, and directors, needs the most help in making the transition. And they’re in the position to do the most with the coaching, helping to sustain and grow it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#CoachingUp</strong> is the better way to solve the abuses that the #NoEstimates fans use to justify their movement. Simply deciding to not provide estimates adds to the already widening gap between traditional management and agile software development teams.</p>
<p>As agile practitioners, we should work with our management teams at all levels to get them the knowledge and information that they need to trust us to deliver our work. Otherwise, it does not matter how you decide to slice your stories. Points or not points, they will still seek traditional ways to manage our agile teams.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Management wants to know how long it will take to get something done. The problem is that people are terrible at estimating features in hours. Why? Because it is hard work, inaccurate, and not a lot of fun. Scrum teams have a better way &#8211; story point estimation.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="505" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SteveDalton-Poker-Planning-Flickr-760x505.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Steve Dalton | Poker Planning | Flickr" title="Steve Dalton | Poker Planning | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Steve Dalton | Poker Planning | Flickr</div>
<p>Hours or duration is complex to estimate on software projects. Teams and individuals are expected to figure out how many hours a particular user story will take to implement – before doing any actual work. It’s not surprising that <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/agile-succeeds-three-times-more-often-than-waterfall" target="_blank">60% of software projects fail at this task</a>.</p>
<p>Hours have a different meaning to different people. Developers have varied skillsets, abilities, competencies, domain knowledge, and experiences. Given a diverse development team, a consensus on how many hours a user story will take to finish will be extremely difficult to reach.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take two developers – Senior and Junior. They have been asked to estimate USER STORY X. Senior, who has many years of experience, thinks that USER STORY X will take 5 hours to complete. Junior, who just graduated from college and is working at his first job, and thinks that it will take 10 hours to complete the story. There is no way to reconcile these estimates and reach consensus.</p>
<p>Even if the hours could be reconciled, the meaning behind the hour estimates are unclear. Is that 5 hour estimate expressed in ideal time or elapsed time? In other words, is that 5 hours of work assuming no interruptions, distractions, and other commitments? OR is that 5 hour estimate really 20 hours in duration because the work was spread over 3 days due to meetings, disruptions, or other life events?</p>
<p>Instead, scrum teams use story points – a unit of measure for the size of a user story. The actual values and units are not as important as the value of the stories relative to one another. A story that is a 10 should be twice the size of a story that is a 5. The estimate is also all inclusive. Everything that is need to get the user story completed is considered in the process.</p>
<p>In our case, Senior and Junior can decide that USER STORY X represents 1 story point. They could then look at other user stories on the product backlog and decide the story point value of the remaining user stories based on their relative size to USER STORY X.</p>
<p>This abstraction removes the complexity of estimating in hours and simplifies the estimate to a relative sizing exercise. <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com" target="_blank">Mike Cohn</a> put it best in his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131479415/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0131479415&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=aganmaco-20" target="_blank"><em>Agile Estimation and Planning</em></a>:  “A story-point estimate is an amalgamation [consolidation] of the amount of effort involved in developing the feature, the complexity of developing it, the risk inherit in it, and so on.”</p>
<p>Hours based estimating is popular, but it is also more complex. It is also frequently wrong. There are many variables that are out of your control that you end up having to factor in (more guessing) or ignore (bad guessing).</p>
<p><strong>Estimating is waste.</strong> Customers do not pay for estimates. You can’t claim ROI from an estimate. Scrum teams do not deliver estimates at the end of every sprint, they deliver working software. Estimates have no intrinsic value. So why invest a lot of time on them?</p>
<p>Since scrum teams know that they are going to be “wrong” when estimating, they use story point estimation to quickly and inexpensively size their user stories. As they inspect and adapt their work during and after each sprint, they can revisit their estimates and adjust as needed.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The agile community is vibrant and passionate &#8211; full of people with great ideas on how to deliver valuable work. It can also be a difficult place to visit. We need to fix that.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/QuinnDombrowskiHeyListenFlickr-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Quinn Dombrowski | Hey Listen! | Flickr" title="Quinn Dombrowski | Hey Listen! | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Quinn Dombrowski | Hey Listen! | Flickr</div>
<p>To change the heart and mind of another person you first have to understand where they are coming from. You learn their story by listening. I don’t mean the kind of listening where you wait for your opportunity to drop your agile knowledge on the someone.</p>
<p>I’m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening" target="_blank">actively listening</a> to the person and asking clarifying questions. As you gain knowledge about the person you can begin to make suggestions that are relevant to their present situation.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there will not be resistance to your scrum or agile suggestions. People not used to “<em>just in time</em>” planning or “<em>self-organization</em>” will likely not understand the concepts on the first pass. They will probably reject the ideas immediately.</p>
<p>This happens for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong>  Change is scary. It makes your problems transparent and places you in a vulnerable situation. Change means you are taking on something that is new to you. What if you look stupid? <strong>What if you fail?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Success:</strong>  Management and project leaders have built careers on waterfall practices. Many have found success and promotions by adhering to predictive processes and practices. Convincing these people that agility is a more productive path is challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Culture:</strong>  Even if the results are not perfect – <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/agile-succeeds-three-times-more-often-than-waterfall" target="_blank">half of all waterfall projects struggle to deliver</a> – people like the comfort of a culture they know and understand. In an agile world many traditional project behaviors do not play well. The rules change.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this all boils down to is a user story that we are all working against when promoting agile in our organizations:  <strong>AS A PERSON I WANT PREDICTABILITY IN ORDER TO FEEL SAFE.</strong></p>
<p>It is a tough nut to crack. But this user story is our reality. Where do we begin?</p>
<p><strong>Be kind.</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember when you were first introduced to agile? For me it was reading Kent Beck’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0321278658&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=agileanswer-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Extreme Programming Explained</em></strong></a>. I loved that book. It just made sense to me. And over the past 12 years since reading it, I’ve worked on my agile game. Guess what?<a href="http://agileanswerman.com/help-the-scrum-master-is-the-impediment/" target="_blank"><strong> I still struggle.</strong></a></p>
<p>The truth is we all struggle. So be kind!</p>
<p>Agile is nuanced. And it is hard. If it wasn’t hard, agile coaches would be out of work and you wouldn’t be reading this blog. “<em>It depends</em>” is a common answer in our world, we work hard to push new ideas, and the agile space changes constantly. So be kind.</p>
<p>Being kind means that we accept that the first sprint of a new scrum team isn’t going to be perfect. It means that when answering a question online we do not belittle or berate people who are honestly seeking insights and feedback. It means we listen first, then speak.</p>
<p>Kindness is also shown when we are patient with those who still cling to their predictive processes, waterfall tendencies, and command and control mindsets. The path to agility is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time to create new habits and practices. So be kind.</p>
<p>People do not show up to work with the intention of ruining your day. They have many of the same pressures that you do: spouse, kids, bills, and bosses. I believe that most people want to do the right thing. Let&#8217;s be the humble servant leaders that the agile principles call us to be and help them come around to the agile way of thinking. Listen, learn, and lead.</p>
<p>And yes, let&#8217;s be kind.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scrum teams rely on metrics to inspect and adapt. Taken too far, the metrics tend to lose value and in some cases cause harm.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="508" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RobertDonovan-Velocity-Flickr-760x508.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Robert Donovan | Velocity | Flickr.com" title="Robert Donovan | Velocity | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Robert Donovan | Velocity | Flickr.com</div>
<p>Last week I wrote about <a title="5 Agile Metrics to Measure High-Performance Scrum Teams" href="http://agileanswerman.com/5-agile-metrics-to-measure-high-performance-scrum-teams/" target="_blank">5 agile metrics to measure high-performance scrum teams</a>. At the top of the list was the most controversial metric that scrum teams use: velocity. This seemingly simple metric is just a measurement of how much effort a scrum team can complete within a given sprint.</p>
<p>Velocity is &#8211; in its simplest form &#8211; the sum of the story points completed in a sprint.</p>
<p>The temptation that many organization face is to turn velocity in to a performance metric.</p>
<p>For instance, I was recently asked what I thought about setting an objective to increase the team’s velocity by 10% by the end of the year. My answer: <strong>It’s a terrible idea</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encourages gaming:</strong>  An intelligent scrum team will realize that if they gradually inflate their estimates over the course of a year they will hit their 10% objective &#8211; <strong>WITHOUT</strong> delivering more value to the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing velocity is not the goal of scrum:</strong>  We are interested in delivering valuable, high quality software to our companies in a sustainable way. How does a 10% increase in velocity get the scrum team there?</li>
<li><strong>Quality suffers as a result:</strong>  A scrum team that is forced to increase velocity will have to make tradeoffs to complete the additional stories required to get the numbers higher. Quality inevitably suffers when these types of decisions are made.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of unknowns:</strong>  Scrum team members leave the company, they get sick, and go on vacation. An estimation can also be way off – it is an ESTIMATION. If the scrum team learns something new about a story, velocity can dramatically go up or down.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another idea that managers try is to compare the velocity of one scrum team with another. This is usually an attempt to normalize velocity across multiple scrum teams. It’s a meaningless comparison as scrum teams have different skills, goals, tools, and approaches to estimating work.</p>
<p>Flame wars often flare up over questions like: “Does a scrum team get credit for the story points related to bug during a sprint?”</p>
<p>Some scrum team members say, “Yes! We did the work and it should show on our velocity.” Others say, “No way, you already got credit for that story and are now cleaning it up. No double dipping!”</p>
<p>Mike Cohn did a great job of answering the question <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/know-exactly-what-velocity-means-to-your-scrum-team" target="_blank">here</a>. Essentially, he says pick whichever way makes sense to your team and be consistent. Easy, right?</p>
<p>Questions like these come up regularly and show a general lack of understanding of how velocity should be used.</p>
<p>Velocity is a limited metric that can only tell you what you achieved in the past and could possibly do in the future. During sprint planning it can help a team avoid over committing. During a sprint retrospective an up or down trend in velocity could lead to a discussion about the team’s definition of done or other team practices.</p>
<p>And there is the value that comes from tracking velocity. It is in the conversations that it causes the scrum team to have. These discussions are opportunities for the team to inspect and adapt their practices. The new insights will hopefully lead to more valuable, working software being delivered to the organization.</p>
<p>Which is important because according to the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a>, “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to attend <a href="http://agile2014.agilealliance.org/" target="_blank">Agile 2014</a> in Orlando this year. Fortunately, the agile community loves to share. While reading the many blogs and tweets from the conference, I spotted a trend:   Scrum co-creator, <a href="http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ken Schwabe</a><a href="http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">r</a>, wants the word &#8220;<em>agile</em>&#8221; back.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="570" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GedCarroll-Pow-Flickr-760x570.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Ged Carroll | Pow | Flickr" title="Ged Carroll | Pow | Flickr" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Ged Carroll | Pow | Flickr</div>
<p><strong> &#8220;What is Agile?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>After returning home from Agile 2014, Mr. Schwaber <a href="http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/agile/" target="_blank">offered an answer</a> on his blog.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Any software activity that conforms or attempts to conform to the values and principles of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto for Software Development</a>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>For those of you that are new to agile and scrum, <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">The Agile Manifesto for Software Development</a> has 4 value statements that drive the activities and behaviors of agile teams.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Individuals and interactions <strong>OVER</strong> process and tools.</em></li>
<li><em>Working software <strong>OVER</strong> comprehensive documentation.</em></li>
<li><em>Customer collaboration <strong>OVER</strong> contract negotiation.</em></li>
<li><em>Responding to change <strong>OVER</strong> following a plan.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</em></p>
<p>The second question that Mr. Schwaber addressed in his post is:  &#8220;<em>If you could add another value to the Agile Manifesto, could you state it?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>His answer is excellent.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We value practices, tools, consulting, coaching, and software organizational work that continuously improve their adherence to the Agile Manifesto <strong>OVER</strong> Tools, products, methodologies, processes, practices that only use the word Agile to market themselves to make money and whose correlation to the Agile Manifesto is coincidental.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The latest scaling trends in the agile community feel like nothing more than money grabs. In fact, according to posts on Twitter, Mr. Schwaber said just as much during his talk:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kschwaber">@kschwaber</a> &#8211; a lot of people here will take your money for things that do not contribute to Agility! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Agile2014?src=hash">#Agile2014</a></p>
<p>— Steve Spearman (@sgspearman) <a href="https://twitter.com/sgspearman/statuses/494132128259403779">July 29, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>So where do we go from here?</p>
<p>There are upcoming events that have embraced the sentiments that Mr. Schwaber shared. These groups are working hard to get agile coaches and agile teams to put the spot light back where it belongs &#8211; on the values!</p>
<p>On September 26th &#8211; 28th the <a href="http://blog.agilecoachcamp.us/" target="_blank">Agile Coach Camp </a>is taking place in Indianapolis, Indiana. This &#8220;un-conference&#8221; seeks to push the limits in guiding software development teams, managers, leaders and beyond, <strong>while staying true to the values and principles at the core of the Agile movement</strong>.</p>
<p>The ideal attendee is a passionate agile practitioner who is active in the field and excited about sharing what they&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>Agile Coach Camp is a peer to peer learning experience in an <a href="http://blog.agilecoachcamp.us/what-is-open-space/" target="_blank">OpenSpace</a> setting with <a href="http://abiggera.me" target="_blank">Deborah Hartmann-Preuss</a>  facilitating this year.</p>
<p>If you also feel that the agile community has drifted away from the core values, this <a href="http://blog.agilecoachcamp.us/" target="_blank">Agile Coach Camp</a> is an excellent opportunity to connect with agile coaches who share your concerns. The conference tickets start at $89.00 USD.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the conference here:  <a href="http://blog.agilecoachcamp.us" target="_blank">Agile Coach Camp | Indianapolis, IN | September 26th &#8211; 28th</a></p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the heart of the scrum master role is servant leadership. We are driven by serving our teams as teachers, mentors, and coaches. It’s our job to help the team remove impediments, not to become one.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="506" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BrandonGlasley-Facepalm-flickr-760x506.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Brandon Glasley | Facepalm | Flicker.com" title="Brandon Glasley | Facepalm | Flicker.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Brandon Glasley | Facepalm | Flicker.com</div>
<p>As a newly minted <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments/PSM-I-Assessment" target="_blank">Professional Scrum Master (PSM I)</a>, I returned to my team excited and ready to get underway. Unfortunately, I brought back a purist view of scrum and had not fully grasped the concept of servant leadership. <strong>In other words, I failed miserably</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem started in the daily scrum&#8217;s. I took a heavy handed approach and ran the meeting how *I* saw fit. I asked the questions of each scrum team member and asked follow-ups where I felt *I* needed more information.</p>
<p>During a sprint planning meeting, I pressed the team to use the <strong><em>AS A</em> &#8211; <em>I WANT</em> &#8211; <em>IN ORDER TO</em></strong> format for user stories. The team came up with their own format that they felt more comfortable with. And still I pressed on.</p>
<p>Why I felt the authority to do so is beyond me. User story formats are not prescribed by scrum. A development team member approached me and very respectfully disagreed with me in many of these areas. Tension grew between us.</p>
<p>After a particularly stressful daily scrum, he stormed out and I was left with a team of amazed developers staring back at me&#8230;disappointed. <strong>And they were fully justified.</strong></p>
<p>I tracked down the developer that stormed out and after a tense, but respectful meeting I finally started to see the errors of my ways.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9087537204/agileanswer-20" target="_blank">Scrum &#8211; A Pocket Guide</a> tell us that &#8220;The scrum master has no interest in scope, budget, delivery, or tasks but coaches and facilitates the complete ecosystem in scrum to manage them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>I was still being a project manager.</strong> That was no longer my role.</p>
<p>I apologized to the team and they showed me a lot of grace by giving me another chance. We went on to deliver some amazing sprints and managed to bring some real value to bear for the business. But why did the conflict happen?</p>
<p><strong>I struggled with giving up the command and control mentality.</strong></p>
<p>Scrum masters who transition from a traditional project manager role must initially cope with the fact that they are not in control of the team. Scrum masters have no direct authority. <strong>We are a servant to our team.</strong> Our role calls us to help the team get better at playing the game of scrum.</p>
<p>As coaches, we must be careful to not turn adopting scrum in to people being coerced to follow new practices. People can typically handle change given enough support, but they are universally defensive in the face of coercion.</p>
<p>The developer &#8211; who rightly challenged the way I was behaving &#8211; embodied the <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-values-can-make-or-break-your-agile-project/" target="_blank">scrum values of respect, commitment, focus, openness, and courage</a>. He had the <strong>courage</strong> to speak up, the <strong>commitment</strong> to the team to want to do things better, the <strong>openness</strong> to air a grievance, the <strong>respect</strong> to keep things civil, and the desire to <strong>focus</strong> the team on valuable work.</p>
<p>If you find yourself on a team where the scrum master has become an impediment you have a number of choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Nothing:</strong> Allowing the behavior of an errant scrum master to continue undermines the scrum adoption and disrespects the entire scrum team. This option isn&#8217;t really an option.</li>
<li><strong>Address the Issue Privately:  </strong>The advantage of this approach is that you give the scrum master the opportunity to realize their mistake without an audience. I appreciated this approach when I had lost my way. If it&#8217;s difficult for you to address the issue 1:1 then the next venue is the sprint retrospective meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Address the Issue During the Sprint Retrospective:</strong> If the 1:1 approach did not work, the team can bring up the behavior of the scrum master as an impediment during the sprint retrospective meeting. When the team discusses what did not go well or what made them mad/sad the scrum master should be brought up. Done respectfully, this conversation could lead to a positive outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Organize/Self-Manage:</strong> The scrum team is a self-organizing/self-managing entity. If the scrum master is not getting the message after multiple attempts, the scrum team does have the right to select a new scrum master. It would be an unfortunate turn of events, but in some cases this drastic step is necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful for the developer who challenged me to be a better scrum master. He made me confront my fear of giving up control and helped me become the servant leader that I needed to become for the scrum team to be successful.</p>

<p>I enjoy Bob Galen’s <a href="http://rgalen.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> quite a bit. In a recent post &#8211; “<a href="http://rgalen.com/agile-training-news/2014/4/22/2-dozen-weird-agile-metrics-ideas" target="_blank">2 Dozen Wild &amp; Crazy Agile Metrics Ideas</a>” – he presents 24 wild and crazy agile metrics that a scrum team could add to their agile toolkit. It’s an excellent read that made me pause and wonder what scrum teams really should be measuring.</p>
<p>After some careful thought, I’ve landed on what I think are the 5 agile metrics that teams should focus on and the benefits that these metrics can bring to scrum teams:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Velocity:</strong> When we track velocity, we are expressing how much effort (story points) a scrum team can get to “done” during a sprint. With velocity, the trend is more important than any individual measurement. As the trend stabilizes, teams can forecast their product backlog. Release planning also becomes easier for the product owner.</li>
<li><strong>Defect Density:</strong> The number of bugs discovered during a sprint. This measurement is a call back to the scrum team’s commitment to quality. The lower the number of bugs the better. Again, the trend is important. An increasing number of bugs sprint-over-sprint could mean that the team is taking on too much work. A downward trend could point to changes in the definition of done improving quality.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> How happy is your customer? The simplest method I’ve used is a simple web application that asked customers how they feel about the current sprint. They could select a smiley face, a frown face, or a neutral face. If a customer picked a frown face they were asked to provide additional comments. The goal is measure satisfaction over time and to also address negative feedback quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Team Satisfaction:</strong> Is your team happy? This is a measurement that could be gathered at the end of each sprint retrospective. The measurement could be the results of a “fist of five” question, or it could be a survey similar to the customer satisfaction metric. Scrum teams should keep an eye on this trend and use the “5 Why’s” and other techniques to get to the root cause of whichever way the trend is going.</li>
<li><strong>Value Per Sprint:</strong> This metric measures how much value the scrum team is delivering back to the customer/business/organization. One of the components of a story card is value. Scrum teams can use this value and measure a trend. The product owner could also provide a value in dollars that represents the impact of the sprint. A downward trend in this metric could indicate that lower value features are being implemented and that it is time to stop development on the product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that these are team metrics, not individual ones. I’ve also put a much higher value on trends than on individual data points. Finally, agile metrics and trends should be taken with a boulder of salt. You won&#8217;t find a silver bullet buried in the data that solves all of the scrum team&#8217;s problem. But hopefully you&#8217;ll use some of these agile metrics to kick off an interesting conversation with the team.</p>
<p><strong>**UPDATE</strong>:  These metrics are for the team to use to enable continuous improvement. They are not for managers to use to drive artificial &#8220;improvements&#8221; within the team. In future posts I&#8217;ll discuss my views on metrics belonging to the team, not management. Thanks to <a href="http://www.scrumcrazy.com/ScrumCrazy.com+-+Charles+Bradley" target="_blank">Charles Bradley</a> for his thoughts and messages on this important distinction.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Scrum Master is demanding a higher <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1110" target="_blank">velocity</a> during the next sprint. Does the scrum development team have to listen or has the scrum master overstepped?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="515" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Velocity-760x515.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Beat Kung | Emc2 | Flickr.com" title="Beat Kung | Emc2 | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Beat Kung | Emc2 | Flickr.com</div>
<p>No, the scrum master has overstepped.  The scrum master is a member of the scrum team &#8211; not its manager. The Scrum Master can ask the development team to increase velocity, but cannot force it.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master can only ask because increasing velocity means adding more work to the sprint backlog. The development team owns the estimates and they also decide how much work they can take on during a sprint. Any increase in work &#8211; even to increase velocity &#8211; must be approved by the scrum development team.</p>
<p>Yes, the development team could deflate their estimates to achieve the same thing. But let’s assume that the scrum master would catch on to that scheme pretty quickly. Let&#8217;s also eliminate the possibility of increasing the length of the sprint to increase velocity. The math works, but it&#8217;s also an easy gimmick to spot.</p>
<p><strong>Scrum teams are self-managing and self-organizing. The concept of force does not play well in this context.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend for a moment that a scrum master could demand a higher velocity from the development team. Here are possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decrease in quality:</strong>  A team that has an imposed metric is forced to cut corners to meet the new demands. Quality is the first thing to go in these types of situations. It becomes very easy for a team to decide that in order to meet an unrealistic date they must stop writing unit test. Or even worse, that they should stop testing all together.</li>
<li><strong>Increased technical debt:</strong>  A scrum team that is under the gun is not likely to make the right decisions. Over time, a series of compromises in quality and architecture will lead to increased technical debt. Ironically, additional technical debt will reduce velocity in the future as the system becomes too fragile and complex to change easily.</li>
<li><strong>Demoralized Team:</strong>  Scrum is a developer play. At its core is the empowerment of the development team. Self-organization and self-management remove the traditional command and control levers from software development. Add those back in by forcing an arbitrary velocity and you&#8217;ve taken away the scrum development team&#8217;s ability to own their work. And along with that their morale.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scrum master in this example was not acting as a servant leader. Remnants of a command and control structure are still present in this situation. More likely, this is a case where the development cannot do their best work due to impediments that still exist in their organization.</p>
<p>If the scrum master believes that a higher velocity is possible, he/she should ask the team: <strong>What can I do to help you be faster?</strong></p>

You sense there must be a better way to gauge the mood of the team, but you are not sure how. Give Fist of Five voting a try.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="505" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fist-760x505.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Unknown | Fist | Flickr.com" title="Unknown | Fist | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Unknown | Fist | Flickr.com</div>
<p>Fist of Five voting is a facilitation technique that scrum masters use to measure the level of confidence in a value statement &#8211; at a point in time. Scrum teams use their fingers to vote which makes our scale is 1 to 5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Five Fingers:</strong> “Yes! I’m 100% aligned with the value statement.”</li>
<li><strong>Four Fingers:</strong> “I strongly support the value statement.”</li>
<li><strong>Three Fingers:</strong> “I want to discuss the value statement before giving my support.”</li>
<li><strong>Two Fingers:</strong> “I oppose the value statement.”</li>
<li><strong>One Finger:</strong> “NO! Absolutely not! The value statement is insane.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, during a Daily Scrum meeting, the scrum master could ask the team: “<em>How confident are you that we are on track to meet the sprint goal?”</em></p>
<p>With the scale in mind, the scrum team thinks about the question and comes up with an answer. When the team is ready, they show the number of fingers that represents their response.</p>
<p>The 1’s and 2’s would then be asked to talk about why their confidence is low. <em>“What is stopping you from voting higher?”</em> is a key question for these scrum team members to answer. After their initial discussion, the scrum team can vote again and see if they are more aligned than before.</p>
<p>Fist of Five voting has five clear benefits to scrum teams that use it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low ceremony:</strong> Fist of Five is very simple to do. All you need is a question and a fist. After that it is up to the team to discuss their scores and work towards alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Encourages participation:</strong> People who are not involved are not committed to the scrum team. Fist of Five gets all of the team members involved in the conversation. The 1&#8217;s and 2&#8217;s get a non-confrontational opportunity to express their concerns, allowing the team to learn as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>Easier “<em>No</em>”:</strong>  No is an incredibly hard word to say. Especially when you have to say it to your teammates. Fist of Five allows scrum team members the chance to disagree with the team or the question being asked without being disagreeable. <a href="http://agileanswerman.com/scrum-values-can-make-or-break-your-agile-project/" target="_blank">Openness</a> is achieve and truthful conversations occur.</li>
<li><strong>Creates alignment:</strong>  An aligned team is a powerful one. The goal of the vote is get the team to collaborate and converge on an agreed up on number.  Taking the time to address the 1&#8217;s and 2&#8217;s gets everyone &#8220;on the bus&#8221; and creates a bonded team that can be successful.</li>
<li><strong>Leads to action: </strong> The alignment process tends to draw out the reasons that scrum team members are not confident. Perhaps the automated build isn&#8217;t so automated. Or maybe there is a major flaw in the architecture that makes the sprint goal difficult. Knowing these impediments gives the team a clear list of action items to work on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fist of Five is a technique that can be used any time you sense that the team lacks confidence. The status of the current sprint, the likelihood of achieving the sprint goal, or even the state of the backlog are all great areas to try it out.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you&#8217;ll find that numbers are really secondary to the rich conversations that your scrum team engages in and the actions they ultimately take.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During our last sprint, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" target="_blank">defect</a> was reported against a user story from the previous sprint. I *think* we should create a new user story and plan on fixing the defect during the next sprint. Is this the right approach?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="584" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bug-760x584.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Paolo Valdormon | Bug | Flickr.com" title="Paolo Valdormon | Bug | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Paolo Valdormon | Bug | Flickr.com</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the story was released to production after the previous sprint and that the product owner accepted the work. This means that the scrum team is in the middle of their next sprint and have an established sprint goal and sprint backlog.</p>
<p>With these types of questions, I like to start with the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide" target="_blank">scrum guide</a>:  &#8220;<em>During a sprint, no changes are made that would endanger the sprint goal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>According to the rules of scrum, the scrum team should treat the defect as a new PBI (product backlog item) and have it prioritized by the product owner. It can be added to the next sprint if it is ranked higher than the other stories on the backlog.</p>
<p>At the end of the current sprint, the scrum team should discuss the defect during the sprint retrospective and look for ways to improve their definition of done to prevent defects like the one reported from happening again.</p>
<p>That’s the theory. From a practical point of view, if the defect is minor AND can be rolled in to a story that is currently being worked on then the scrum development team can go ahead and fix it.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a common pattern that scrum development team must avoid. In these types of situations, many developers make the decision to fix the defect on their own.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that they could unintentionally impact a higher priority user story on the sprint backlog. This would put the  sprint goal is in jeopardy which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p><strong>When fixing the defect could jeopardize the sprint goal the product owner must be brought in to the conversation.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scrum.org/scrum-Guide" target="_blank">scrum guide</a> also supports this approach: &#8220;<em>During the sprint, scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the product owner and scrum development team as more is learned.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>A reported defect is an opportunity for the scrum team to learn more about their software. It is also an opportunity to work with the product owner to determine the best way to handle the defect.</p>
<p>All software has defects. Some the scrum team finds, other remain hidden. Some defects get immediate attention, and others can wait.</p>
<p><strong>This decision belongs to the product owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the scrum development team decides to work on the defect without the knowledge of the product owner, they lose transparency. Without transparency it is impossible to properly inspect and adapt the scrum events and scrum artifacts.</p>
<p>This loss of insight in to the development process erodes trust between the scrum development team and the product owner. Under these conditions it is unlikely that scrum teams will achieve the results that are expected from agility.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know the <a href="http://www.scrum.org" target="_blank">scrum</a> values? Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage are the five scrum values that drive agility. Understanding them can lead to better decisions, higher quality work, and a truly agile environment.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="323" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Top-Value-Image-760x323.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Wandering Magpie | Top Value Trading Stamps | Flickr.com" title="Wandering Magpie | Top Value Trading Stamps | Flickr.com" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Wandering Magpie | Top Value Trading Stamps | Flickr.com</div>
<p>These scrum values are critical to understanding the &#8220;why&#8221; of scrum. They act as the guideposts when the team gets lost. More importantly, the scrum values drive the decisions that impact our daily work. Failing to understand the scrum values will prevent a team from improving their ability to deliver value.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commitment:</strong>  Commitment is a dirty word in the agile world. It reminds people of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart" target="_blank">gantt charts</a> and deadlines. But a commitment is a truly powerful thing. It is a promise to either yourself or others to deliver. Scrum teams make a commitment to the product owner during every sprint. Scrum team members make a commitment to each other to adhere to scrum.</li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong>  People work better when they are not distracted. Valuing focus means that we give people the time they need to think about their work. Creativity is hard enough without constantly being interrupted! Insisting that team members are focused on one project, one sprint, and one task at a time gives the team the best chance of delivering on their commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Openness:</strong>  Clear minds and open hearts can do a lot of good in the world. This is especially true for agile projects. Only open minds can conduct effective sprint retrospective meetings. Openness is at the core of transparency, which is what makes scrum work. If scrum is not transparent, there can be no inspection or adaptation. This effectively means that without openness, there can be no improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Respect:</strong>  Transparency is scary. Admitting when you are stuck is hard. Respect makes these actions possible. A high-performing scrum team is built on mutual respect. Frank discussions require respect to stay constructive. Respect for peers removes the &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; mentality and helps a team gel, grow, and learn together.</li>
<li><strong>Courage: </strong> Courage is the linchpin for the other scrum values. It takes courage to commit. It takes courage to focus and tell other competing activities &#8220;no&#8221;. It takes courage to be open to new ideas. It takes courage and faith in your team to count on respectful interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the importance of the scrum values, a scrum master should coach their teams on them regularly. Here are two suggestions that scrum masters can use to help their teams become more familiar with the scrum values:</p>
<ol>
<li>During your next sprint retrospective, write each value across the top of a white board. Ask the team to come up ways that they applied each value during the last sprint. You should also ask how the values were violated. This exercise will hopefully lead to a discussion about each scrum value. Over time, this will create a common understanding about how each value applies to the team.</li>
<li>If your team is more action oriented you can try framing each scrum value as a deliverable on the team backlog. The <a href="http://www.agileconnection.com/article/identifying-and-improving-bad-user-stories" target="_blank">story format </a>can be used to make the &#8220;value stories&#8221; actionable.
<ol>
<li><strong>[AS A]</strong> scrum team member <strong>[I WANT]</strong> to show up on time to scrum events <strong>[IN ORDER TO]</strong> show respect to the team.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When deciding to play the game of scrum we are accepting not only the practices, but also the scrum values. Now that you understand them a bit better you can focus on applying them to your daily activities. Over time you see should improvements in not only the deliverable, but in how the team members interact with one another.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide" target="_blank">scrum master</a> on a team that is doing well. Recently you&#8217;ve noticed that some team members put in more effort and hours each sprint, than others. You want to bring this up during the next retrospective, but are unsure what is the best way to do it. Is presenting a report showing the average hours worked by each person the right way to go?</p>
<p><img width="760" height="608" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/slackingatwork-e1404356525882-760x608.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="What Does a Scrum Master Do When a Team Member is Not Performing" title="What Does a Scrum Master Do When a Team Member is Not Performing" /></p><div style="font-size:11px;line-height:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-align:center">Tim Patterson | Slacking at Work | www.flickr.com</div>
<p>This question is unfortunately becoming more and more common. Newly minted scrum masters often struggle giving up the control that traditional project management positions gave them. The right question to ask in this situation is:  <strong>Why is a scrum master watching the clock?</strong></p>
<p>Scrum Masters are in a position of servant leadership. We are tasked with managing the scrum process, not the team members. We are coaches, not task masters. Presenting a report of hours worked is against the agile values and could cause deeper issues for the team.</p>
<p>Defining &#8220;effort&#8221; as the average number of hours worked is a terrible metric to use. The time it takes to complete a task could be based on many factors. The experience levels of the developers, the difficulty of the task, and dependencies on other activities can all lead to team members needing varying hours to complete their work.</p>
<p>Using an average hours worked report during the sprint retrospective meeting could also work against the team maintaining a sustainable pace. The scrum team members working fewer hours could suddenly feel pressured to work longer hours. <strong>People need down time to do high-quality work.</strong> Longer hours puts the team at risk by burning out the developers and potentially decreasing the velocity of future sprints.</p>
<p>In this case, the scrum master should first dig in to whether or not the variable hours is actually an issue. Is the team&#8217;s velocity trending down? Are more defect being reported by the end users? Is the customer still satisfied with the value being delivered each sprint? These are the types of questions that a scrum master can use to verify that a problem exists.</p>
<p>Another option is to ask the team during next retrospective if they have taken on too much work. It is possible that the root cause of more hours being worked is simply not limiting the amount of work in progress. If that is not the case, perhaps the stories and tasks are not being broken down in to small enough deliverables. These are all great areas for a scrum master to help the team investigate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide" target="_blank">Scrum</a> calls for teams to be self-organizing and self-managing. This is a real responsibility that scrum team member take on when deciding to do scrum. In the event that a team mate is not keeping up their end of the deal, the team must be willing to address the issue.</p>
<p>As scrum masters we can help guide the team through these difficult conversations and lead them to positive ways to correcting the problems.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My 4 year old son, Dawson, can self-organize, self-manage, and solve problems on the fly. He and his friends naturally exhibit the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">agile values</a> and scrum practices that many adults struggle with daily.</p>
<p><img width="760" height="503" src="http://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DawsonPost-760x503.jpg" class="featured-image wp-post-image" alt="Scrum Master Lessons" /></p>
<p>My wife and I went to a cookout this past weekend. When we arrived, our son Dawson ran for the back yard and joined in on a game of hide and seek. Watching this unfold, I realized that these kids are naturally agile.</p>
<p>They got straight to playing (the value) and didn&#8217;t need a lot of ceremony to get there. They did a quick hello, told Dawson what game they were playing, and invited him to join in (daily scrum). Then they played.</p>
<p>This realization led me to 7 more things that Dawson has taught me about being a scrum master:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is this going to hurt?</strong> &#8211; My son likes to ask this question when he’s about to do something new. It’s a reasonable question and one that a scrum master should be asking as well. When the scrum team makes a decision to try something new it should be done so knowing both the positive and negative impacts that it could have on the team.</li>
<li><strong>Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?</strong> &#8211; Anyone with a 4 year old knows that they are masters of the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys" target="_blank">5 whys</a>”. This line of questioning can be stressing after a long day, but it is also invaluable when trying to get to the root cause of an issue. This technique is excellent at getting past the technical and in to the interpersonal issues that a team could be facing.</li>
<li><strong>Play Well with Others</strong> &#8211; Dawson loves to include people. He does not have a divisive bone in his body. Neither does scrum. There is no concept of “us vs. them” in agile. The business and IT cannot be at odds if the goal is to deliver value, or in Dawson’s case &#8211; to have fun.</li>
<li><strong>Time Box Events</strong> &#8211; My wife and I know that we have about two hours between Dawson’s bathroom breaks. Kids have small bladders. We risk breaking this time box at our own peril. The same is true with scrum. When the time box expires, the sprint is over. No exceptions.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Pace is Important</strong> &#8211; Kids need naps. When we push Dawson past his nap time everyone suffers. The same is true after the 3rd week of a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management)" target="_blank">death march</a>” and the developers can no longer see straight, let alone deliver high quality code. Everyone is suffering and very little value is being delivered.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Opportunities</strong> &#8211; Sometimes you have to let your kids fail. These moments are great learning opportunities. The same is true with scrum. There are times as a scrum master that the best thing you can do is sit back and let a disaster happen. We learn from our mistakes. These moments not only provide lessons, but can also help a team gel and grow.</li>
<li><strong>Watch Your Mouth</strong> &#8211; Kids repeat the wrong words at the wrong time. Your team &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s new to agile &#8211; can do the same. Scrum Masters must be intentional with their words and ensure that they are clear about scrum and how the practices work. As a coach, team members look to you for guidance. A quick way to lose the team’s trust is to give inaccurate advice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kids are a blessing. They can also teach us quite a bit if we are willing to watch and listen. Next time you see a group of kids playing a game, pay close attention to how they organize and manage the process. I’m certain there are many more lessons that can be mined from these experiences.</p>

<p>During a particularly difficult daily scrum meeting I noticed that the team was asking a lot of questions about scrum basics. When does the next sprint start? Why is this meeting only 15 minutes? Why do we have to table technical details until later? The entire team had just gone through scrum training and should have known these things.</p>
<p>At the end of the daily scrum I asked the team one final question:  <strong>Who here has actually read the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide" target="_blank">scrum guide</a>?</strong> Not every hand went up. I strongly suggested to the team that they read the scrum guide as soon as possible, and this is also my first suggestion for you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the Scrum Guide&#8230;Often:</strong>  I read the scrum guide 2-3 times per week. Why? Because each time I read it something new stands out to me. The time spent here is an opportunity for me to inspect my own understanding of scrum and to gain new insights.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Relationships:</strong>  Not all problems can be solved with unit tests and pair programming. XP practices aside, poor relationship between the product owner and the end users can lead to requirements not being understood and features being rejected. Practice using the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys" target="_blank">Five Why’s</a>” in cases where you suspect relationships are an issue. It is an effective tool that moves the conversation from the technical to the interpersonal very quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect the Artifacts:</strong>  When reading the scrum guide, apply the pillars of agile (transparency, inspection, and adaptation) to the artifacts of scrum. The definition of done is an interesting place to start. It is a list of criteria that must be met before a feature can be called &#8220;done&#8221; (transparency). It is used by the developers and product owner to evaluate features during a sprint (inspection). During the sprint retrospective, the definition of done can be improved to meet the needs of the upcoming sprint (adaptation). Applying the pillars to the scrum artifacts is a great way to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; of scrum.</li>
<li><strong>Favor Empowering the Team:</strong>  One of the hardest tasks for a new scrum master is removing impediments. The urge is to jump in and solve the problems as they come up. But this does not create an empowered team. To truly empower a team, the scrum master must get comfortable with a key question. <strong>How can I coach the team to remove this impediment?</strong> Apply this question regularly and your teams ability to handle issues will grow.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Self-Organization:</strong> Scrum explicitly gives the power back to the developers. Respect this! Your developers know who is needed on the team to accomplish the sprint goal. Trust them to get the right work to the right people. Enable them to determine how the work will be done.<strong> Rules and mandates that come from outside of the team often end up as impediments during the daily scrum meeting.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s the soft skills that help us get better at scrum. In a profession where technical skills go a long way, this can be a scary. The good news is that you get better at scrum by being aware. The practices above promote awareness and lead to questions scrum masters should be asking themselves and the team members on a regular basis.</p>
<p>These discussions bring out a deeper understanding of scrum, which is bound to take your scrum skills to the next level.</p>
