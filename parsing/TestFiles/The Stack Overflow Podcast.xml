	<itunes:subtitle>A look inside the Stack Exchange Network</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Hosted by Joel Spolsky with Jay Hanlon and David Fullerton, the Stack Overflow podcast lets you listen in on discussions and decisions about the Stack Exchange Network. The Stack Overflow podcast gives you an unparalleled view into how a startup is created and built.

About Stack Overflow:
Stack Overflow is the flagship property of a fast-growing network of over 100 question and answer sites on diverse topics from software programming to cooking to photography and gaming. We are an expert knowledge exchange: a place where physics researchers can ask each other about quantum entanglement, computer programmers can ask about JavaScript date formats, and photographers can share knowledge about taking great pictures in the snow.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast episode #69, brought to you by The Lake Erie Soda Water Company. Your host is Joel Spolsky, joined by First Deputy of Community And So Forth Jay Hanlon and Lord High King of Nerds David Fullerton. Fortunately, the beer arrived shortly after the podcast began, so this one should be pretty good.</p>

<p>By the way, we&#39;re changing everything. We should talk about that! First, let&#39;s review: you may remember how <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/09/stack-exchange-podcast-68-a-badger-a-horse-and-a-dik-dik-the-documentation-episode/">the last time we had a podcast</a>, we talked about Documentation. It&#39;s now in private beta, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13ynCK-DEy0osod8VIENajnbFJNZxXm1jyeupBrl5v44/viewform">you can sign up</a>.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the new stuff: we&#39;re working on something we&#39;re calling integration, or possibly unification. The legend has it that once upon a time, Stack Overflow was invented, and so was this bolted-on Careers site where programmers could get jobs. But they were two separate things, and if you wanted to get a job through Stack Overflow, you had to go to a whole different website and make a whole different account. Our unification project will move all of that stuff back into the Stack Overflow fold, making it an unobtrusive part of your day-to-day experience on the site. (Which you can just ignore if you aren&#39;t looking for a job.)</p>

<p>We asked a sample of people signing up for Stack Overflow today if they were actively searching for a new job, not searching but open to opportunities, or not interested in jobs at all. We found that of those who answered, 23% were actively looking for jobs and 38% were open to opportunities. (There&#39;s a point here, but we digress to talk about Twitter&#39;s new hearts.) Oh, here&#39;s the point: 61% of new Stack Overflow sign-ups might be interested in the right new job. What all of this means for the average Stack Overflow user is that you no longer have to bother to keep a second profile on a separate site. Oh, and if you&#39;re at all interested in finding a new job, we want to be able to help you look for one in--here&#39;s the kicker--a way that isn&#39;t awful.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been thinking about ways we think we can continue to help help make developers&#39; lives easier. We&#39;re not about programming on a boat or making designer shoes for programmers. We&#39;re just about helping programmers learn, improve, and share their knowledge, and that&#39;s why Documentation and Jobs feel like natural fits into what we&#39;re already doing well with Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>[Producer Alex is now eating delicious seaweed snacks. Further bulletins as events warrant.]</p>

<p>So! By now we&#39;ve <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310066/865899">talked about integration a little bit on MSO</a>. We&#39;re trying to take the pain out of the Jobs piece as quickly as possible while we&#39;re building out these other features. </p>

<p>But wait. Joel makes an excellent point: why are we working on all of this new stuff instead of going back and fixing all of the problems with Q&amp;A? Well, the answer is... why not both? Let&#39;s be clear: <strong>this is not about any shift in our focus on Q&amp;A.</strong> Q&amp;A is the thing that we&#39;re confident that we&#39;ve done really well, and it&#39;s what our community is built on and uses to teach a new generation of programmers in a new way. Q&amp;A is the killer feature, and it will stay that way. You know what? Just listen to David for this part, because my attempts to summarize his impassioned monologue are coming off cheesy and/or arrogant, and he&#39;s really nailing it. (Don&#39;t tell Jay I complimented David; he&#39;ll kick me off his team.)</p>

<p>Okay. Moving on! <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308601/865899">Teams</a> is in private beta and you can <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/nosBAAcbvG">sign up to participate</a> if you want, or just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/teams">check out the teams that have already signed up</a>. (So far, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/teams/122/netguru">NetGuru is winning</a> the non-competition.) Tune in for more Teams talk. We&#39;re gonna get a lot of stuff wrong at the beginning, like we always do, so we look forward to community input on how Teams should evolve.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/state-of-the-stack-2010-a-message-from-your-ceo/">Here&#39;s the post</a> Joel is talking about when he says &quot;Harley Davidson Bike Buckle&quot; a bunch of times. Also, Joel is a hypnotist. Also, we&#39;re done now, so thanks for wasting another hour of your life listening to the Stack Exchange Podcast!</p>

Your hosts today are David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky, with special guest <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/80572/kevin-montrose">Kevin Montrose</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what seersucker looks like (in case you were wondering about it while the gang talks about seersucker for a weirdly long time):</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOKhP.jpg" alt="you&#39;re the seersucker, buddy"></p>

<p>(<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seersucker#/media/File:Seersucker01.jpg">image via wikipedia</a></em>)</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got two exciting things to talk about. First up: <strong>Stack Overflow has 10 MILLION QUESTIONS!</strong> We made <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/10m">a web page</a> to celebrate, because that&#39;s what geeky web companies do. If you&#39;re too lazy click on that link don&#39;t worry because Jay eventually just starts describing the page to you. (Predictably, the conversation quickly devolves from celebration to discussion of how we can actually measure activity and helpfulness. Views? Sessions? Answers?) To celebrate, we asked folks to share their Stack Overflow stories <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOreadytohelp">on Twitter with #SOreadytohelp</a>. Tons of people have shared so far (which may have something to do with the fact that you could win a t-shirt). </p>

<p>Some of Jay&#39;s favorite selections:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">StackOverflow is the definition of all what&#39;s noble about this field: knowledge, sharing, rigor and dorky jokes. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOreadytohelp?src=hash">#SOreadytohelp</a></p>-- Ahmed (@halflings) <a href="https://twitter.com/halflings/status/634481409349013505">August 20, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>(The dorkier, the better.)</p>

<p>(Oh no! Our secret&#39;s out!)</p>

<p>Okay, enough of that boring celebratory stuff. Our next topic is so big and exciting that I think it warrants a horizontal rule:</p>

<hr>

<p>Welcome to life <em>below the fold</em>.</p>

<p>So! It&#39;s time to talk about what Stack Overflow could do next. It was just about a year ago that we thought to ourselves: &quot;we need more things besides questions and answers!&quot; At least that&#39;s how Joel remembers it. To make a long story short, we&#39;re talking about a possible new content type: <strong>Documentation</strong>.  If you haven&#39;t read <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303865/865899">the meta post</a> yet, you might want to skim it while you listen to this part. (I&#39;ll wait right here.)</p>

<p>Done skimming? Welcome back. We&#39;re still talking about documentation. As it currently stands all around the internet, documentation is frequently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Poorly written or included as an afterthought</li>
<li>Out of date</li>
<li>Incomplete</li>
<li>Lacking in clear examples</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re thinking the Stack Overflow community can help improve the situation the way it did with Q&amp;A, and we think that&#39;s the next thing we can do to serve developers. Here&#39;s what it <em>could</em> look like: </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0bqw.png" alt="i believe the docs are our future">
(<em>image via <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303865/865899">kevin&#39;s meta post</a>, seriously, go read it</em>)</p>

<p>Documentation is a really early-stage project, which is why we went to the community for feedback. We&#39;re still figuring out what level the docs will be at (but we already know there will be NO <code>toString()</code> DOCS ALLOWED). </p>

<p>Also, the Power Glove used to be a thing: </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAhTh.jpg" alt="who knows why we&#39;re talking about this"></p>

<p>(<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove">image via wikipedia</a></em>)</p>

<p>After a bunch of discussion, David has determined that we&#39;re about halfway through the Documentation project: we&#39;re 6-8 weeks in, and <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19514/165581">we&#39;ve got 6-8 weeks to go</a>. Perfect!</p>

<p>Questions from the audience: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/23817346#23817346">Is SO inadvertently going to make projects stop writing their own docs?</a> Maybe, but we doubt it. Other Q&amp;A sites and forums still exist elsewhere on the internet, and documentation will too.</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/23817350#23817350">How <strike>did you</strike> do you plan to solve the issue of distributing reputation for a collaboratively edited page of documentation?</a> The short answer is we aren&#39;t sure yet, and we have to observe how people actually use docs in the private beta. One thing we&#39;ve kind of decided is that we don&#39;t think it makes sense to take rep away from you when someone else adds to something you wrote. (If you want to help solve this problem, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13ynCK-DEy0osod8VIENajnbFJNZxXm1jyeupBrl5v44/viewform">sign up for the beta</a>!)</li>
<li>(paraphrased) <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/23817342#23817342">Why are you working on a Stack Overflow-specific new content type instead of something more applicable network-wide?</a> The short answer is that it&#39;s really hard to solve problems or develop tools for hundreds of diverse needs, and you&#39;ll probably be bad at most of them if you try. If we&#39;d set out to solve Q&amp;A for the internet at large (instead of just programming) we wouldn&#39;t have ended up with Stack Overflow and it probably would have been worse for everyone. But something like documentation could be useful for a lot of sites, once we figure out how it will work for developers. Also, we have to very aggressively constrain so we can iterate as quickly as humanly possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jay wants to talk about some other stuff, so here&#39;s another horizontal rule so nobody gets confused.</p>

<hr>

<p>We haven&#39;t talked about new sites in a while, so here&#39;s a very brief rundown:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a <a href="http://law.stackexchange.com">Law</a> site now</li>
<li>We have an <a href="http://opensource.stackexchange.com">Open Source</a> site, which deals with open source software and also other things that are not software </li>
<li>We have a <a href="http://portuguese.stackexchange.com">Portuguese Language</a> site</li>
<li>We have a <a href="http://computergraphics.stackexchange.com">Computer Graphics</a> site</li>
<li>We had an Arabic site at time of recording, but it&#39;s closing due to low activity levels</li>
<li>For more, have a look at <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#newest">the list of newest Stack Exchange sites</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for joining us!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange podcast episode #67, recorded live from Stack Exchange HQ in NYC on August 11, 2015. Today&#39;s podcast is brought to you by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockwell_Garage">the Stockwell Garage</a>, a Grade II* Listed Building since 1988. Joining us on today&#39;s podcast are Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, host Joel Spolsky -- and special guest <a href="http://twitter.com/anildash">Anil Dash</a> of <a href="https://makerba.se">Makerbase</a>! (Anil says he&#39;s never been invited on the podcast before, but that is <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/23367254#23367254">a dirty lie</a>.)</p>

<p>Many know Anil because he comes free with every new Twitter account. There is a <em>small</em> number of other places you might know him from:</p>

<ul>
<li>He&#39;s on <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/management">the board of Stack Exchange, Inc.</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s on the board of <a href="http://www.datasociety.net">Data &amp; Society</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s on the board of <a href="http://www.girlsclub.org">the Lower East Side Girls Club</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s on the board of <a href="https://nytm.org">NY Tech Meetup</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s an advisor to <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s an advisor to <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org">Donors Choose</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s a founder of <a href="http://activate.com">Activate</a></li>
<li>He and <a href="https://twitter.com/ginatrapani">Gina Trapani</a> founded <a href="https://www.thinkup.com">ThinkUp</a></li>
<li>He and Gina just released <a href="https://makerba.se">Makerbase</a></li>
<li>He co-created <a href="http://monegraph.com">Monegraph</a> (not to be confused with MoneyGram)</li>
<li>He directed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_Labs">Expert Labs</a></li>
<li>He&#39;s got <a href="http://anildash.com">a little blog you might have heard of</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>When Anil started blogging, he felt he was late to the party (and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/daily-news/2014/11/twitter-anil-dash">said so in Vanity Fair</a>).  And while it&#39;s true that he didn&#39;t invent blogging (<a href="http://links.net">Justin did</a>, probably), he certainly wasn&#39;t late to the scene either - he started his blog in 1999. Also, he&#39;s Prince&#39;s #2 fan (right behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questlove">?uestlove</a>).</p>

<p>So! Anil&#39;s current all-consuming project is <a href="https://makerba.se">Makerbase</a>, which is sort of like IMDb for digital projects. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zgZF5.jpg" alt="Makerbaes."></p>

<p>His cofounder Gina built the site while Anil sat around and watched supportively. <a href="https://makerba.se/m/629vqi/spolsky">Joel is in there already</a>, because anyone can add or edit a page for a maker or project. Makerbase helps increase transparency in the digital world (so founders can stop getting all the credit for features and things that other people actually made).</p>

<p>Makerbase is really simple: there are makers and projects. No companies, no job titles. Just makers and projects. You can add things you worked on for six months at your job, or just something you hacked up as a side project over the weekend, and Makerbase treats those projects equally.</p>

<p>Makerbase was a little bit of a &quot;pivot&quot; for ThinkUp (and by &quot;pivot&quot; Joel actually means that ThinkUp is &quot;a company with two products&quot;). <a href="https://www.thinkup.com/join/">ThinkUp</a> is &quot;social media analytics, but way more interesting than that sounds&quot;. You hook up your Twitter or Instagram or whatever you have, and ThinkUp will tell you who your biggest fans are or that you should dial down your cursing. In a nutshell, it&#39;s sort of like the opposite of Ashley Madison. (You&#39;ll have to listen to the podcast to get that joke.)</p>

<p>Jay asks Anil what project he&#39;s most proud to work with, and Anil deftly avoids the question by observing that computer science programs don&#39;t have ethics classes baked in, like law or medicine programs do. This is an odd disconnect, Anil feels, because software has immense power to create and alter culture. So a lot of the organizations Anil has gotten involved with address the intersection of technology, policy, and culture.</p>

<p>David observes that the tech industry is shifting toward design in addition to (as opposed to?) straight-up technology. At some point, we all started to recognize that programmers are just not good designers, and that design is not just beauty: it&#39;s a real discipline that is worth thinking about. Jay says there&#39;s an indescribable element to it (and then he describes it adeptly). Design has been an integral part of the 30- or 40-year march toward accommodating people.</p>

<p>Next, we ask Anil about how he spends a lot of time and energy thinking and speaking about social issues that are important to him. (He compares his efforts to learn from as many people as possible with Stack Overflow, and <em>we didn&#39;t even know he was going to say that</em>. Win!) Also--and this is related, in a &quot;you had to listen to the show&quot; kind of way--it&#39;s awesome when folks come along with you when you nerd out about something. That&#39;s why you should read <a href="http://anildash.com/2014/07/i-know-times-are-changing.html">Anil&#39;s blog post about Prince&#39;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; video</a>. And here&#39;s a link to Paul Ford&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What is Code?</a> piece.</p>

<p>Jay asks Anil the best way for people to use their powers for good: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest thing is to ask yourself what you are probably getting wrong, and who can help you get it right. I think that&#39;s it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(That was way too deep, so we&#39;ll end with a warning that it&#39;s <a href="http://camworld.org">camworld dot ORG</a> and you should NOT try the other one unless you want your IT department to look at you funny.)</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to the Stack Exchange Podcast!

Whew.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange podcast episode #66, recorded live at Stack Exchange HQ in New York, NY on July 7, 2015. Today&#39;s podcast is brought to you by The Association of Ex-Fog Creek Summer Interns (AEFCSI). Today&#39;s show is hosted by the usual suspects Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky, plus ex post facto Producer Alex.</p>

<p>First up: it&#39;s important to note that David is a charter member of the Association of Ex-Fog Creek Summer Interns, from way back before Fog Creek knew how to do internships (his words). He made <a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/docs/70/topics/schedules/Evidence-BasedScheduling.html">graphs in Flash</a> and that was his whole internship.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EjWyA.png" alt="Much graph. Very Flash. Wow."></p>

<p>So! Let&#39;s talk about features. The coolest one we have for you today: now, when you log in on one site, we log you in everywhere. You can read about it <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/260153/165581">on meta</a>. It seems like a no-brainer, but it was harder than it seemed, and that&#39;s why it took about 94 years. Turns out login is hard. Who knew? (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/155160/anna-lear">Anna Lear</a>, who has to work on this monster project, did. So did <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/2/geoff-dalgas">Dalgas</a>.)</p>

<p>In other news, we updated our blog, which you can see if you&#39;re reading this blog post. We moved off of Wordpress and onto <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which is the only CMS in the world that doesn&#39;t have its own Stack Exchange site. The new blog is <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/stack-blog">open source</a>, btw, so you can kick the tires. [Editor&#39;s note: some issues with the blog migration and our iTunes feed are why this podcast was published so belatedly, and why you can&#39;t listen to it in your podcast app just yet. Use the SoundCloud link below while we work that out.]</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/165581">re-vamped what it means to graduate</a>, and since this recording we&#39;ve announced plans to tweak graduation <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/260754/165581">even further</a>. Essentially, what&#39;s going to happen is that we&#39;re going to consider any site for graduation if it hits 10 questions per day over a certain period, and then it&#39;s going to get a site design by Joel done totally in emoji. Some of this is true and some of it is false. You decide! (Also in this section: <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/22625563#22625563">tangents</a>.)</p>

<p>Next topic: reddit. What the heck happened? Joel doesn&#39;t know because he was busy flying a drone into a swimming pool that weekend (true story). Oh, and <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/22625824#22625824">here&#39;s the drawing the hosts start talking about in the middle of the drone story.</a> Then we finally get to the reddit story, which is that Alexis Ohanian aka /u/kn0thing once tried to eat a spoonful of cinnamon on our show, way back <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2013/02/podcast-43-false-facts-blood-feuds/">in episode 43</a>. And apparently something else happened at reddit, too. Jay and Joel walk us through the basics of the story (and David reminds us continually that we have no idea what actually happened).</p>

<p>Related: <a href="http://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/q/1224/1">What should we do to reduce the risk of a Reddit-like crisis?</a></p>

<p>Basically, our assessment is that reddit moderators felt unsupported by reddit inc., and at Stack Exchange we have always strived to make sure our mods don&#39;t feel that way. (We don&#39;t always succeed, but we do our best--and have since way before reddit exploded. Just saying.) We are entirely dependent on our community, and our mods are the members of the community who give the most. A community isn&#39;t something a VC or company can own. Companies can <em>serve</em> communities, and once they stop doing that (hi Digg!), the community will leave--as well it should.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson we can take away is that we have to listen to the things our community is asking us to fix. For reddit, it was moderator tools. For us, it&#39;s been things like the quality problem and people talking about how mean Stack Overflow is, which people <a href="https://medium.com/@johnslegers/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d">like to write about on the internet</a>. (Read this post by <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/298712/865899">Bill the Lizard</a> instead of the original post, btw.) </p>

<p>We abruptly thank you for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #66 brought to you by the AEFCSI!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast, episode #65, recorded Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at Stack Exchange Headquarters in New York City. Todayâs podcast is brought to you by the Association of Airline Mile Programs and hosted by the usual suspects.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast, episode #65, recorded Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at Stack Exchange Headquarters in New York City. Todayâs podcast is brought to you by the Association of Airline Mile Programs and hosted by the usual suspects.</p>

<p>Weâll start off with the extremely important and community-relevant subject of why Joel hates frequent flyer programs. Itâs a fascinating story and I canât do it justice in summary. But I will say, for those of you who find it TOO ENTERTAINING AND DRAMATIC, that this story ends around 7 minutes into the show. 7:16 to be exact.</p>

<h3>Things we are working on that are very similar to airline miles programs:</h3>

<p><strong>Site designs!</strong> Weâre updating them. All of them. The down side of giving every graduated site a custom design is that when we want to design something newâa new user profile, for instanceâwe have to design it fifty times. So weâre standardizing all of our designs and modernizing a few of them so we can roll new stuff out more easily. <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Ask Different</a> and <a href="http://android.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Android Enthusiasts</a> are good examples of what weâve been up to. You can find the full list of updated sites (and those still waiting for updates) <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/253359/list-of-communities-with-base-css-updates-completed" target="_blank">on meta</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile updates!</strong> Weâve released updates for both of our mobile apps (on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). (The Windows Phone app is still in the planning stages; the current plan is to wait until Windows runs iOS apps.)</p>

<p><strong>Data stuff!</strong> Weâre working behind the scenes to make your experience on Stack Overflow and Careers better (or at least more relevant to you). Weâre improving Careers matching, which makes us able to match you with better job ads in the sidebar, and to recommend more relevant jobs to people who go to Careers. Itâs also related to the stuff weâre using to recommend you questions on the Stack Overflow homepage that you might want to answer, and THAT in turn is related to the Next Answer Hook, in which we try to find you more questions to answer that are similar to the question you just answered.</p>

<h3>Things that already happened which we havenât yet talked about (enough):</h3>

<p><strong>The new user profile!</strong> Itâs the big thing that we launched since the last podcast. Jayâs going to talk about it <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/04/two-new-user-pages-one-new-stat-this-ones-big/" target="_blank">because he wrote the blog post</a>. Weâve been working on this for a looooong time. Joel will give the overview, for those who havenât been paying attention, and who also didnât read the blog post I just linked. The short version is that we split your profile into two parts: the part you care about (Activity), and the part other people care about (Profile).</p>

<p>We talk about this for a while. The most important part of the discussion is that if you enjoyed this podcast, you can mail Joel Spolsky a note. You can find the officeâs mailing address <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/contact" target="_blank">on the website</a>. And in case you were TOO FASCINATED by this tangent, Jay brings us back to the topic of the new profile features around minute 31.</p>

<p>(By the way, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/253668/help-us-identify-micro-privileges-for-top-users" target="_blank">hereâs the thread about new privileges</a>, where you can suggest anything as long as it isnât animated GIF backgrounds for your profile.)</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that weâspecifically Jay and Davidâlearned a lot about how to manage projects, products, and processes through this experience. Okay. Whew. User profile page talk: done (around 56:00).</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast, episode #65, recorded Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at Stack Exchange Headquarters in New York City. Todayâs podcast is brought to you by the Association of Airline Mile Programs and hosted by the usual suspects.

Weâll start off with the extremely important and community-relevant subject of why Joel hates frequent flyer programs. Itâs a fascinating story and I canât do it justice in summary. But I will say, for those of you who find it TOO ENTERTAINING AND DRAMATIC, that this story ends around 7 minutes into the show. 7:16 to be exact.

Things we are working on that are very similar to airline miles programs:

Site designs! Weâre updating them. All of them. The down side of giving every graduated site a custom design is that when we want to design something newâa new user profile, for instanceâwe have to design it fifty times. So weâre standardizing all of our designs and modernizing a few of them so we can roll new stuff out more easily. Ask Different and Android Enthusiasts are good examples of what weâve been up to. You can find the full list of updated sites (and those still waiting for updates) on meta.

Mobile updates! Weâve released updates for both of our mobile apps (on Android and iOS). (The Windows Phone app is still in the planning stages; the current plan is to wait until Windows runs iOS apps.)

Data stuff! Weâre working behind the scenes to make your experience on Stack Overflow and Careers better (or at least more relevant to you). Weâre improving Careers matching, which makes us able to match you with better job ads in the sidebar, and to recommend more relevant jobs to people who go to Careers. Itâs also related to the stuff weâre using to recommend you questions on the Stack Overflow homepage that you might want to answer, and THAT in turn is related to the Next Answer Hook, in which we try to find you more questions to answer that are similar to the question you just answered.

Things that already happened which we havenât yet talked about (enough):

The new user profile! Itâs the big thing that we launched since the last podcast. Jayâs going to talk about it because he wrote the blog post. Weâve been working on this for a looooong time. Joel will give the overview, for those who havenât been paying attention, and who also didnât read the blog post I just linked. The short version is that we split your profile into two parts: the part you care about (Activity), and the part other people care about (Profile).

We talk about this for a while. The most important part of the discussion is that if you enjoyed this podcast, you can mail Joel Spolsky a note. You can find the officeâs mailing address on the website. And in case you were TOO FASCINATED by this tangent, Jay brings us back to the topic of the new profile features around minute 31.

(By the way, hereâs the thread about new privileges, where you can suggest anything as long as it isnât animated GIF backgrounds for your profile.)

The moral of the story is that weâspecifically Jay and Davidâlearned a lot about how to manage projects, products, and processes through this experience. Okay. Whew. User profile page talk: done (around 56:00).

Itâs finally time forâ¦

Community Milestones!


We have a Health site in public beta.
CiviCRM is in public beta too â and we have no idea how to pronounce it.
Woodworking is in (you guessed it) public beta.
Stack Overflow in Russianâthe artist formerly known as HashCode.ruâhas officially launched, and is doing phenomenally.


Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast Episode #65. For a special treat stay tuned after the credits for the Very First Episode of the Stack Overflow Podcast, starring Joel and co-founder (emeritus) Jeff Atwood.

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MumAz.jpg" alt="Podcast studio construction project" /></p>

<p>Our podcast today is brought to you by string cheese! (It can be eaten by pulling strips from the cheese along its length and eating those strings.) Our hosts are Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky, joined today by guest Roberta Arcoverde.</p>

<p>Roberta is visiting NYC on vacation, and she&#39;s obviously doing a terrible job taking time off because here she is at work. Roberta joined the team in March 2014 and has been working on Careers ever since. She&#39;s currently our only employee in Brazil. (We used to have another employee in Brazil, but he moved to Ithaca, which has Cornell University, rain, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours">its own currency</a>.)</p>

<p>Anyway. Roberta&#39;s not from Ithaca. She&#39;s from Rio de Janeiro and she works on the Careers team, where her first big project was our internal Candidate Query Language (CQL). As a computer science researcher working with languages and compilers, she was really pumped to work on this project. It&#39;s what allows employers to do advanced searches on our candidate database. </p>

<p>More recently, Roberta&#39;s working on rewriting our message processor, Back Office. It used to be written over <a href="https://servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a>, which we&#39;re phasing out, even though we love it (and Demis used to work with us). Discussion of ServiceStack and what it&#39;s good at (and where it falls short for us) ensues. And <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis">StackExchange.Redis</a>. And <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">Wasabi</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>.</p>

<p>Moving on...</p>

<p>Roberta&#39;s been working remotely from Brazil since she started with us, and it&#39;s her first time working for a remote company. At Stack Exchange we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">try really hard to make remote culture work</a>. Now we do stuff like Remote Bev Bash, where we get everyone to grab a beverage and hop in a Google Hangout together on Fridays. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/115866/balpha">balpha</a> figured out how to rig two hangouts together so we don&#39;t have to worry about participant limits.) One time we made origami, and one time <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2/geoff-dalgas">Dalgas</a> joined the bev bash from a pub. It&#39;s how we make remote work work. </p>

<p>(Also, very importantly, Roberta&#39;s going to get another cat, and name it either Donut or Chelsea (or Alan).)</p>

<p>Roberta didn&#39;t apply to work here when she first saw the listing (even though she knew David worked here). She knew we were a great company making a product admired by many, but felt hesitant about applying because <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/team">the team page</a> made the dev team looked like a boys&#39; club. (This was June 2013, when the dev team was 100% male.) Fortunately for us, she changed her mind - thanks in large part to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/11/podcast-54-the-one-with-all-the-anachronisms/">our podcast with guest Sara Chipps</a> which reassured her that we&#39;re aware of our representation problems and we want to make them better. We&#39;ve learned a lot about how to represent our open jobs over the past few years, and we hope folks from all walks of life feel confident <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">applying to work with us</a>.</p>

<p>(We&#39;re relieved that Roberta joined our team and discovered that we are not jerks. Well, most of us aren&#39;t.)</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">Here&#39;s a link to the results of our developer survey</a>, in case you got to this part in the conversation and wondered where it was.</p>

<p>Roberta&#39;s hesitance to apply with us isn&#39;t surprising given lots of her past experiences with programming while female. Example: at a conference last summer, which she attended as a representative of Stack Overflow wearing a Stack Overflow t-shirt, one of the conference <em>organizers</em> assumed she was a booth babe. Lots of people visiting the Stack Overflow booth addressed their technical questions to Gabe, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/introducing-gabe-the-smiling-community-manager/">who does <em>not</em> work as a developer here</a>. This is the kind of thing that happens all day every day in real life and on the Internet.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iMePz.jpg" alt="Roberta "Not A Booth Babe" Arcoverde" /></p>

<p>Another relevant link: <a href="https://medium.com/@sailorhg/coding-like-a-girl-595b90791cce">Coding Like a Girl</a>.</p>

<p>So, how can we fix it? How can we make sure we&#39;re not turning more amazing programmers like Roberta away from our company because of our image? For starters, we&#39;re trying to be more open and public about our commitment to the idea that diverse teams create better products. We toss around some ideas about changes we could make on the sites to improve diversity and visibility, too. What it boils down to is that if you can see people who look like you doing a thing (being president, working for Stack Exchange, etc), you&#39;re more likely to believe you can do it, too. (And that&#39;s why Joel will never go to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Graceffa">Joey Graceffa</a> meetup.)</p>

<p>One thing we need to work on is shouting at each other less on hangouts, because not everybody likes to make decisions that way. We have a lot of healthy disagreement, and we&#39;re proud of that, but we have to figure out better ways to do that without making everyone feel like they have to defend themselves.</p>

<p>So what can we get better at? We put Roberta on the spot but she&#39;d rather talk about all the stuff we&#39;re working on so far. If you (the podcast listeners) have ideas, we&#39;re always happy to hear them in the comments or <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com">on meta</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #64, brought to you by string cheese. See you next time!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast Episode #63, recorded March 6, 2015 in front of <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512/2015/3/6">a live-ish audience</a>. Today&#39;s podcast is brought to you by Cool Whip by Kraft Foods. A description for this result is not available because of this site&#39;s robots.txt -- learn more! Our hosts today are Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon... as usual.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s new? David went to London. (We have an office there. It&#39;s awesome and it has <a href="https://twitter.com/balpha/status/569776309901131776">graffiti on the walls</a>.) David flew out to meet the London marketing team, spend time with some of our European developers, and get knighted. Probably.</p>

<p>This story didn&#39;t really go anywhere, so we&#39;ll take <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=20410986#20410986">an audience question</a> and then move on to talking about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review">review queues</a>. Specifically: <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/287466/help-improve-the-help-improvement-queue">the Help &amp; Improvement queue</a>. (Let the record show that Joel asked for this feature approximately 700 years ago. [So did <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5052/flagging-a-question-for-improvement-without-voting-to-close">Jon Skeet</a>. -Ed.])</p>

<p>The Help &amp; Improvement queue (aka the helpers queue, aka the huggy queue) contains questions that were deemed &quot;Should Be Improved&quot; in the <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/278380/help-us-test-question-triage">triage queue</a>. The triage queue <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=20411106#20411106">is working very well so far</a>. (There are numbers with percentages and two decimals of accuracy, so they are obviously really good.) Instead of talking about it more, let&#39;s just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/helper">go check it out</a>! Here&#39;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28801791/how-to-convert-png8-in-graphicsmagick">the question Joel was working with</a>.</p>

<p>Joel discusses some questions thatÂ got as much help as they deserved (if not more), including an example that got some helpful edits comments. But without better information from the askers, these questions were still never going to getÂ good answers. User <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/656243/lynn-crumbling">Lynn Crumbling</a> has a <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=20411567#20411567">new badge idea</a>: Almost Famous -- had a question closed by Joel.</p>

<p>After many tangents, here are the takeaways from our experience so far with the helpers queue: we need to think about how to better control what&#39;s going into the queue, and we need to give the reviewers <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/288385/hiq-very-low-quality-link">more ways to deal with questions that shouldn&#39;t be in there</a>.</p>

<p>Right! Let&#39;s talk about closing. But first we get sidetracked and talk about <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2015/03/05/how-we-upgrade-a-live-data-center/">moving datacenters and blogging about it</a>. It&#39;s a great post, especially if you&#39;re into this kind of thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of NY-VM01&amp;02 was 1 of the 1Gb FEXes and 1U of cable management. Luckily for us, everything is plugged into both FEXes and we could rip one out early. This means we could spin up the new VM infrastructure faster than we had planned. Yep, weâre already changing THE PLANâ¢. Thatâs how it goes.
(Oh, and the SRE team got snowed in and had to sleep in the datacenter. There&#39;s that, too.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here&#39;s the blog post we actually <em>meant</em> to talk about: <a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/741.php">My Love-Hate Relationship with Stack Overflow</a> by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/44330/jason-s">Jason S</a>. It inspired David to come back from vacation to rant about it in chat for an hour. He helpfully re-creates this rant (with help from Joel and Jay) live on the podcast!</p>

<p>So what came out of this discussion? <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/250223/165581">We changed close vote aging</a>, for one thing. Community Manager <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1438/jon-ericson">Jon Ericson</a>&#39;s <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/286407/865899">meta post thought experiment about close voting</a> was another.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #62, recorded live on January 20th--with aÂ <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19636047#19636047">live studio audience (kinda)!</a>. Today&#39;s podcast was brought to you by the American Venture Capital Association. With you today are our hosts Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s jump right in: we madeÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-stack-exchange/">a big announcement</a>! Andreessen Horowitz has invested a pile of money in our little company so we can improve our &#39;programmer forums&#39;. Precisely none of the pile of money is going into Jay&#39;s raise, but one of those dollarsÂ <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637567#19637567">is going to SomeKittens</a>.</p>

<p>So, the (forty) million dollar question:Â <strong><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637602#19637602">how are we going to use this money</a>?</strong></p>

<p><em>(not on supporting ancient browsers.)</em><br>
<a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637817#19637817"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHEFZ.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We intend to (continue) spending money on <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>. Our goal is toÂ <strong>get every programmer a better job</strong>, and we want to do that without selling crazy-takeover-animated-bonzaibuddy-ads that feel like reading a newspaper on the subway (according to Joel), so we&#39;re getting money from investors instead.</p>

<p>How are we going to make this happen? We plan to revisit the developer side of the Careers equation and figure out how to make that better. More features to let programmers search and filter for interesting jobs, update the way profiles work, etc. - more of the stuff we were going to work on anyway. Careers is already a very developer-focused product: we limit the things our employers can do heavily based on what drives programmers nuts. For example, we only let employers contact a limited number of candidates <em>unless those candidates actually respond</em>, and we disallow contingency recruiters. (A pox on all of their houses.) </p>

<p>You can get a Careers profileÂ <a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/get-one">here</a>. We filter the applications to make sure only real programmers end up with profiles on Careers.</p>

<p>Time to take some questions from the peanut gallery!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19637808#19637808"><strong>How will this [investment news] affect the sites?</strong></a>
Not one bit!</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, a few bits. This cash will allow us to hire more designers, so more sites can graduate and get beautiful site designs. We&#39;ll get to hire more people to hit more of our goals at the same time. For example, one of the things we&#39;re actively working on now is <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/277584/feedback-requested-search-engine-usage">improving search</a> on Q&amp;A sites.</p>

<p>Have we mentioned lately thatÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">we&#39;re hiring</a>? Our most urgent need is for product managers, and you can apply for that job even if you&#39;ve never had &#39;product manager&#39; in your job title before.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19638446#19638446"><strong>Will there be someone to represent the rage quitters?</strong></a>
Yes. You&#39;re hired. Thanks for volunteering.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19637981#19637981"><strong>Would you consider being an intermediary, putting a &quot;Buy This Person&#39;s Time&quot; on their profile page or answers?</strong></a>
No! (Sorry,Â <a href="http://brentozar.com/">Brent</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637973#19637973"><strong>Has the Stack Overflow design update changed user behavior?</strong></a>
We&#39;ve noticed a big uptick in the number of people complaining about how blue and cream go together. We&#39;ve also gotten a lot of <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/design">constructive feedback on meta</a> that we&#39;ve used to inform tweaks (but it&#39;s really hard to distinguish those from comments about how people&#39;s cheese has been moved).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638186#19638186"><strong>Can you comment on whether SO rep is useful to a job search?</strong></a>
Lots of employers out there don&#39;t know what Stack Overflow is, but Joel is going to use some of those 40 million dollars to educate them. But from our perspective, posting on Stack Overflow is more like blogging in that it can tell you a lot about a programmer and how they interact with the developer community. Stack Overflow reputationÂ <em>alone</em>Â doesn&#39;t always tell you about the second half of &quot;smart and gets things done&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638845#19638845"><strong>Will you be making a Windows Phone app?</strong></a>
Not for the foreseeable future. This questionÂ <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638851#19638851">makes our mobile lead sad</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638237#19638237"><strong>Are there any plans to add a chat feature to the mobile application?</strong></a>
(Mobile lead Kasra just dropped dead.) We may add chat to the mobile app yet, but it&#39;s not in our 2015 plan.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638594#19638594"><strong>Are we going to ever allow wildcards in searches? Currently in chat it just nulls the search.</strong></a>
Chat search is weird and backwards, but actual site search allows a certain amount of wildcards. This will get a better response if you post itÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/">on Meta</a>Â and our search devs can actually respond!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19639079#19639079"><strong>What happened to the videos idea?</strong></a>
We first thought aboutÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/270574/an-experiment-stack-overflow-tv">Stack Overflow TV</a>Â a while back. We hope to expand into areas of developer learning beyond questions and answers someday, and SOTV is one of those ideas. It will essentially be a YouTube channel with little introductory videos on topics in programming. The idea has hit some snags, but it&#39;s still on our radar.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19639168#19639168"><strong>Do you have any plans to run hackathons to promote local user groups?</strong></a>
Yes! On a small scale, we make our office space available to local user groups who need a place to meet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And we&#39;re out of questions. So what else is going on these days? <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/winter-bash-2014/">Hats!</a> And some <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#newest">new sites</a>. How about new features? We&#39;re experimenting withÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/triage">a new triage queue</a>Â to help sort questions into &quot;hopeless and needs to be burninated&quot; and &quot;could be passable with some editing&quot; buckets. Things in the triage queue won&#39;t show up on the homepage until they&#39;ve been approved.Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/278380/help-us-test-question-triage">Here are the details</a>.</p>

<p>Joel wants to sign off, but first make sure you check outÂ <a href="http://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/">Expression Engine SE&#39;s new design</a>. (Since this podcast was recorded,Â <a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/">Movies SE</a>Â has also graduated with a slick new theme.)</p>

On our show today are David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky. It&#39;s been aÂ <em>long</em>Â time since we last did a podcast, so let&#39;s get started.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First point of business:Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/11/stack-exchange-for-the-ipad-is-here-and-ios-apps-now-support-ios-8/">we have an iPad app</a>! It&#39;s got a snazzier feed and a fancy live preview in the Compose view. We&#39;ve been getting more posts from mobile than we expected, because computing via iPad is the way of the future (according to Joel), so lots of features in the iOS app are now better optimized for posting as opposed to reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving onto far more important business:Â <a href="http://instagram.com/p/unn5CKNOeC/">Joel&#39;s dog Taco got 21,000 likes on Instagram</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>PSA: Always make sure your insurance will cover it before you travel to Kansas City. (Any Kansas City. We&#39;re not sure how many there are, or even which one Joel went to on his zombie visit.)</p></li>
<li><p>Also, Garmin makes boats.</p></li>
<li><p>By the way, we&#39;re still talking about the iPad app, apparently. We&#39;re collecting a lot of data about how our mobile apps areÂ being used to help us gear them better toward the people who are actually using them. Our mobile team (led byÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/229741/kasra-rahjerdi">Kasra</a>) has been working really hard on making the apps shine (despite Joel&#39;s efforts to force random features nobody will use onto them). So try it out (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">iOS</a>,Â <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog">Android</a>) and let us know what you think. We love feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving on! We revamped ourÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice">Be Nice policy</a>Â afterÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240839/165581">hashing it out with the community on meta</a>. (We didn&#39;t handle the feedback part super well. Lessons were learned!) This discussion of it is about as long as the original draft was, so get comfortable.</p>

<ul>
<li>A secondary point of interest: should comments stick around forever, or disappear after 21 days? I bet you can guess Joel&#39;s opinion. (This question is sheerly hypothetical. Nobody&#39;s actually proposing this now.)</li>
<li>A tertiary point of business:Â the numbering of the Ten Commandments <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/1136/639">really is disputed</a> - Joel&#39;s not making this part up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Okay that&#39;s great. Next! Joel tries to bring up diversity (spoiler alert: we&#39;re pro-diversity), but we decide to devote more of a podcast to it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Say, David, what is a Stack Snippet? We&#39;re glad you asked!Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/09/introducing-runnable-javascript-css-and-html-code-snippets/">It&#39;s essentially a loving knockoff of JSFiddle</a>. They help us ensure that our content stays up-to-date and relevant, and they reduce mental friction.</p></li>
<li><p>This is cool: we open-sourced our monitoring system. It&#39;s called &quot;<a href="http://bosun.org/">Bosun</a>&quot; (or &quot;Boatswain&quot;, or &quot;bo&#39;s&#39;n&quot;, or &quot;the first word ofÂ <em>The Tempest</em>&quot;, but we think it&#39;s easiest to stick with Bosun). Listen about it in this podcast, read about it onÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">the blog</a>Â orÂ <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2014/11/10/announcing-bosun/">the Server Fault blog</a>, orÂ <a href="http://bosun.org/gettingstarted.html">just get started</a>. It&#39;s in alpha, but you can check it out. (Major credit to Matt Jibson and Kyle Brandt for their great work on this project.)</p></li>
<li><p>We have a new Q&amp;A site aboutÂ <a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/">Worldbuilding</a>, and it&#39;s doing really well - despite the Community Team&#39;s misgivings about launching it. We&#39;ve shifted toward letting most Area 51 proposals test their legs in private beta - as long as they don&#39;t embarrass us or duplicate or overlap significantly with other sites. That&#39;s why we decided to launch Worldbuilding even though we didn&#39;t understand it - and luckily, they proved us wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3453/44">Could a government control its people using frequencies?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3976/44">Does the sun being blocked affect electricity?</a></li>

<p>We&#39;ve been going for HOURS (one hour), so it&#39;s time to wrap it up. Thanks for listening to the Stack Exchange Podcast episode 61, brought to you by okra!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/07/podcast-60-are-we-that-predictable/podcast-og/"><img src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/podcast-og.png" alt="Stack Exchange Podcast"></a></p>

<p>We&#39;ll jump right into things withÂ <strong>Community Milestones</strong>, but we promise to make them quick.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/">Puzzling</a>Â is now in public beta, and it&#39;s about puzzles.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Data Science</a>Â (DAY-ta, not DAH-ta) is in public beta, and doing better than that topic&#39;s previous iterations.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://craftcms.stackexchange.com/">Craft CMS</a>, yet another CMS site, is now in public beta as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://buddhism.stackexchange.com/">Buddhism</a>Â is now also in - surprise! - public beta.</p></li>
<li><p>Last one:Â <a href="http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/">Hinduism</a>Â is in public beta as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Whew. Time to let Uncle David walk us through about a hundred new features that have launched since our last podcast.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Curtail Recidivism of Q-Blocked/Suspended Accounts on Deletion. This is exactly what it sounds like (unless it sounds like nonsense). This makes it so that people who are blocked or suspended can no longer delete their accounts and create a new, non-suspended account.</p></li>
<li><p>New badges:Â <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/badges/242/curious">Curious</a>,Â <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/badges/243/inquisitive">Inquisitive</a>, andÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/badges/244/socratic">Socratic</a>. These badges go to folks with a consistent pattern of asking good questions, which we hope will help encourage our users to ask more questions.</p></li>
<li><p>We redesignedÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">the Stack Exchange homepage</a>... again. (The pendulum swings.) Make it your homepage! (Or don&#39;t.)</p></li>
<li><p>We also redesignedÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">the Hiring page</a>. You should come work with us!</p></li>
<li><p>And we redesigned the mobile website, which you can check out by visiting any Stack Exchange site from your mobile device (unless it&#39;s a BlackBerry).</p></li>
<li><p>The Community BulletinÂ <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/234453/redesigned-community-bulletin">got redesigned</a>Â as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers</a>Â got a new feature, too:Â <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/explore">City Pages</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s everything we&#39;ve done for the last few months, except for the secret stuff David won&#39;t tell us about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for our Featured Community. This time around it&#39;sÂ <a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/"><strong>User Experience</strong></a>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/31359/should-error-messages-apologize">Should error messages apologize?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/49991/should-yes-delete-it-be-red-or-green">Should &quot;Yes, delete it&quot; be red, or green?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/34126/how-can-users-be-prevented-from-pouring-water-into-the-bean-compartment-of-a-cof">How can users be prevented from pouring water into the bean compartment of a coffee machine?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s time to talk about quality again. Jay is hopeful, because we had a great fight about thisÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/05/podcast-59-hes-one-of-those-science-ists/">last time</a>. Briefly: the perceived quality on Stack Overflow has been in decline for years. AndÂ <em>this</em>Â time, we&#39;ve got numbers and things. Our current homepage algorithm was actively highlighting unanswered questions. WeÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/stack-overflow-homepage-changes/">did this on purpose</a>, but that was a long time ago. The effect of that system is that unanswer*<em>able</em>*Â questions stay on the homepage, because the average and good ones get answered almost immediately. So it makes Stack Overflow look like a site full of bad, unanswered questions.</p>

<p>SoÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=recommended">here&#39;s the new recommended tab</a>. It&#39;s doing two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not filtering out unanswered stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighting toward the tags that you&#39;re interested in, but now with more randomness.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You see a broader distribution of stuff. It&#39;s not perfect, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s a little hidden for now, but we&#39;ll keep working on it!</p>

<p>The other angle we&#39;re attacking this from is the low-quality algorithm. Or rather, the quality score algorithm. (The algorithm itself is very high quality.) We did some science and we threw a bunch of data intoÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowpal_Wabbit">Vowpal Wabbit</a>(not a typo) and built a predictor of question quality, which has given us lots of interesting information to work with. We can use hard blocks and warnings to teach people asking questions things like &quot;add some code!&quot; or &quot;make sure you explain what your code is doing!&quot;. But we don&#39;t want to just tell people not to use certain words, because then they&#39;re only learning not to say &quot;thanks&quot;, not how to write a good question. So the low quality algorithm can flag your question to be sent to a review queue before it can show up on the homepage. Probably. (This is all still up for debate.)</p>

<p>This is primarily a Stack Overflow thing, soÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">Meta Stack Overflow</a>Â is the best place to discuss it. Have at it!</p>

<p>And finally, we&#39;ll discussÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/261505/is-it-true-that-if-someone-reaches-200k-reputation-he-she-gets-a-painting-with-a">the most important meta post of all</a>.</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast episode number 60, brought to you by The National Pepperjack Cheese Council. Your hosts today are Joel Spolsky, Jay Hanlon, and David Fullerton (aka Fake Producer Abby).



We'll jump right into things withÂ Community Milestones, but we promise to make them quick.


PuzzlingÂ is now in public beta, and it's about puzzles.
Data ScienceÂ (DAY-ta, not DAH-ta) is in public beta, and doing better than that topic's previous iterations.
Craft CMS, yet another CMS site, is now in public beta as well.
BuddhismÂ is now also in - surprise! - public beta.
Last one:Â HinduismÂ is in public beta as well.


Whew. Time to let Uncle David walk us through about a hundred new features that have launched since our last podcast.


Curtail Recidivism of Q-Blocked/Suspended Accounts on Deletion. This is exactly what it sounds like (unless it sounds like nonsense). This makes it so that people who are blocked or suspended can no longer delete their accounts and create a new, non-suspended account.
New badges:Â Curious,Â Inquisitive, andÂ Socratic. These badges go to folks with a consistent pattern of asking good questions, which we hope will help encourage our users to ask more questions.
We redesignedÂ the Stack Exchange homepage... again. (The pendulum swings.) Make it your homepage! (Or don't.)
We also redesignedÂ the Hiring page. You should come work with us!
And we redesigned the mobile website, which you can check out by visiting any Stack Exchange site from your mobile device (unless it's a BlackBerry).
The Community BulletinÂ got redesignedÂ as well.
CareersÂ got a new feature, too:Â City Pages.


And that's everything we've done for the last few months, except for the secret stuff David won't tell us about.

It's time for our Featured Community. This time around it'sÂ User Experience!


Should error messages apologize?
Should "Yes, delete it" be red, or green?
How can users be prevented from pouring water into the bean compartment of a coffee machine?


It's time to talk about quality again. Jay is hopeful, because we had a great fight about thisÂ last time. Briefly: the perceived quality on Stack Overflow has been in decline for years. AndÂ thisÂ time, we've got numbers and things. Our current homepage algorithm was actively highlighting unanswered questions. WeÂ did this on purpose, but that was a long time ago.

So it makes Stack Overflow look like a site full of bad, unanswered questions.

SoÂ here's the new recommended tab. It's doing two things:


Not filtering out unanswered stuff.
Weighting toward the tags that you're interested in, but now with more randomness.

This is primarily a Stack Overflow thing, soÂ Meta Stack OverflowÂ is the best place to discuss it. Have at it!

And finally, we'll discussÂ the most important meta post of all.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the 59th running of the Stack Exchange podcast, brought to you by Nutella! Your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon are joined this week by special guests Josh Heyer (aka Shog9) and Robert Cartaino (aka Robert Cartaino) of the Stack Exchange Community Growth team.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a busy podcast scheduled, so let&#39;s get down to business, starting with <strong>New Features</strong> with Uncle David.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are revamping the user profile, and you can <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231112/profile-page-makeover-part-2-the-prototype">check it out and give us feedback</a> (and please do!).</p></li>
<li><p>We are testing some new Careers ads on Stack Overflow. Hang onto your hats, people. We use the words &quot;astonishing&quot; and &quot;frightening&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges?tab=tags&amp;filter=gold">gold tag badge</a>, you can now Insta-Close-As-Dupe. This addresses <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/">the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; problem</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The iOS app is on Joel&#39;s phone, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">it can be on yours, too</a>! If you&#39;re into that kind of thing, you can check out <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/app/Stack_Exchange/c1rF4kxgLUzNc-tv0q7g1v8zjc5a1j?country=GLOBAL">the Quantcast stats</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we&#39;ll come back around to Jay&#39;s Boring Stuff, aka <strong>Community Milestones</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Data Science</a> and <a href="http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/">Puzzling</a> were in private beta at the time of this recording, and by the time we posted this, Puzzling had moved to public beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now we get to switch over to our <em>Big Meaty Topic</em> for the day. At Stack Exchange (and particularly on Stack Overflow), we get a lot of complaints about quality declining on our sites. <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/announcing-the-launch-of-meta-stack-exchange/">We split MSO and MSE</a>, which gave people a chance to talk about their feelings (which is what we intended) and gave rise to questions like &quot;<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758/why-is-stack-overflow-so-negative-of-late">Why is Stack Overflow so negative of late?</a>&quot;. It got a lot of interesting answers and comments.</p>

<p>Essentially, we are scaring legitimate, thoughtful people away from getting help. That&#39;s one side of the problem. Additionally, some of our best users are getting more frustrated than we want them to be and (importantly) expressing that <strong>it&#39;s hard for them to find questions that they want to answer</strong>. That part is something we can actually do something about.</p>

<p>Joel has two very very simple proposals to solve this problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a question gets upvoted by a user with <em>x</em> reputation (or maybe just upvoted), that upvote buys it <em>y</em> more impressions on the front page than the standard rate. Demonstrably good questions get more eyeballs than questions that haven&#39;t been demonstrated to be good.</p></li>
<li><p>Users that are relatively trusted by the system get more impressions on the front page for their questions. If you have a couple hundred reputation and you seem like a trusted user, your question gets more eyeballs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Better questions get more eyeballs and therefore have a better chance of being answered well. Tune in for extensive discussion of the nuances and issues involved in Question Neutrality.</p>

Our hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon are joined this week by our guests, the Stack Exchange Design Team: Jin Yang, StÃ©phane &quot;The French Guy&quot; Martin, Courtny Cotten, and Josh Hynes.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s kick things off with <strong>Community Milestones</strong> (assuming Joel knows where he is).</p>

<li>Joel had a rock computer when he was a kid. We&#39;re not sure that&#39;s a real thing. (UPDATE: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RIC-920-Rock-Identification-Computer/dp/B003ESXRP0/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">it is!</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/">Academia</a> has graduated and has a beautiful new design, thanks to designer StÃ©phane Martin.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The iPhone app is coming! [Ed: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/05/stack-exchange-for-iphone-is-here/">it has now been released</a>!]</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re also working on instant automagical refresh in the apps.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/announcing-the-launch-of-meta-stack-exchange/">The MSO/MSE split happened</a>! But we already talked about it.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re busy breaking Super User by trying to migrate it over to CloudFlare.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming soon... Careers 2.0 City Pages!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Community of the Week</strong>: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/">Travel</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19808/why-do-people-on-airplanes-often-have-tomato-juice-as-a-drink">Why do people on airplanes often have tomato juice as a drink?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3080/ok-were-all-adults-here-so-really-how-on-earth-should-i-use-a-squat-toilet">OK we&#39;re all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2539/how-to-avoid-drinking-vodka">How to avoid drinking vodka?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And now we turn to our special guests! <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/21721/jin">Jin Yang</a> is the founding member of the design team. <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/3815156/stephane-martin">StÃ©phane Martin</a> is the French guy, and he&#39;s in the U.S. for the first time! <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/3426677/courtny-cotten">Courtny Cotten</a> is from Indiana, and <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/3109039/hynes">Josh Hynes</a> is from Pennsylvania. Those places aren&#39;t as cool as France (apparently).</p>

<p>So, what does the design team do? Jin gives us his memorized elevator pitch for what Stack Exchange designers do all day. (It includes beer pong, but probably not in the way you&#39;re thinking.) StÃ©phane designed the <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/">new look and feel for Academia</a> and tells us about the process creating the look and feel for that fully graduated community. Courtny&#39;s worked on the new Careers 2.0 city pages, and Careers search results. Josh worked on reporting, messaging for Careers, and the new user profile page on the Q&amp;A sites. Both of them are working on new features for Careers right now. We alsoÂ delve deeper into Stack Exchange design culture and history. Anecdotes! Anecdotes galore!</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #58, brought to you by our iOS app... and <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/unndy.jpg">Jay&#39;s crappy Batman drawing</a>.</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #58 brought to you by the Stack Exchange iOS app! Our hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon are joined this week by our guests, the Stack Exchange Design Team: Jin Yang, StÃ©phane "The French Guy" Martin, Courtny Cotten, and Josh Hynes.

Let's kick things off with Community Milestones (assuming Joel knows where he is).


Joomla!


IHOP dot com is a Joomla! site.

Unrelated: Donald Knuth mentioned our TeX siteÂ in a recent TUGboat.
Earth Science


Why do snowflakes form into hexagonal structures?
What is the status of the Raymo & Ruddiman idea that Tibet cooled the Earth?
Joel had a rock computer when he was a kid. We're not sure that's a real thing. (UPDATE: it is!)

Academia has graduated and has a beautiful new design, thanks to designer StÃ©phane Martin.


New Features


The iPhone app is coming! [Ed: it has now been released!]
We're also working on instant automagical refresh in the apps.
The MSO/MSE split happened! But we already talked about it.
We're busy breaking Super User by trying to migrate it over to CloudFlare.
Coming soon... Careers 2.0 City Pages!


Community of the Week: Travel


Why do people on airplanes often have tomato juice as a drink?
OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?
Why are airline passengers asked to lift up window shades during takeoff and landing?
How to avoid drinking vodka?


And now we turn to our special guests! Jin Yang is the founding member of the design team. StÃ©phane Martin is the French guy, and he's in the U.S. for the first time! Courtny Cotten is from Indiana, and Josh Hynes is from Pennsylvania. Those places aren't as cool as France (apparently).

So, what does the design team do? Jin gives us his memorized elevator pitch for what Stack Exchange designers do all day. (It includes beer pong, but probably not in the way you're thinking.) StÃ©phane designed the new look and feel for Academia and tells us about the process creating the look and feel for that fully graduated community. Courtny's worked on the new Careers 2.0 city pages, and Careers search results. Josh worked on reporting, messaging for Careers, and the new user profile page on the Q&A sites. Both of them are working on new features for Careers right now. We alsoÂ delve deeper into Stack Exchange design culture and history. Anecdotes! Anecdotes galore!

Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #58, brought to you by our iOS app... and Jay's crappy Batman drawing.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #57, recorded Friday April 11, 2014 with your hosts Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky. Today&#39;s podcast is brought to you by the Heartbleed bug.</p>

<p>We have lots to talk about (which makes Joel scared), starting with <strong>Community Milestones</strong> (after we discuss 2048 strategy, that is)!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://expats.stackexchange.com/">Expats</a> is newly in public beta. It&#39;s a site for people that are dealing with the bureaucratic messes involved in living outside your home country. <a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes">Check out their top-voted questions</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/146/can-i-lose-my-us-citizenship-for-accepting-employment-with-a-foreign-government">Can I lose my US citizenship for accepting employment within a foreign government?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/3/how-do-i-deal-with-ppaca-obamacare-as-an-expatriate-us-citizen">How do I deal with PPACA (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) as an expatriate?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/118/how-to-build-credit-history-in-the-usa">How to build credit history in the USA?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/143/where-can-i-be-tax-resident-when-i-dont-stay-in-any-eu-country-longer-that-6-mo">Tax residency when in the EU for less than 6 months</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>And we&#39;ve added yet another math site to the network: <a href="http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/">Math Educators</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/">Graphic Design</a> has graduated from public beta, and it now has its own beautiful design - check it out! (It&#39;s a great site, but it also helps Jay do <a href="http://imgur.com/OKVS5jx">things like this</a>.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That brings us to our <strong>Community of the Week</strong>: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/">Information Security</a>. (For the record: horses <em>can</em> live in barns.) Info Security has gotten a lot of traffic lately thanks to our sponsor, the Heartbleed bug. (We wonder if we&#39;re spelling &quot;security&quot; wrong for a while before we realize the site is down. So we&#39;ll come back to this.)</p>

<p>Aaaanyway... let&#39;s talk about <strong>New Features</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The iOS app is going to come out in the next 6-8 weeks, but you can still <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228422/stack-exchange-ios-app-nearing-beta">sign up to test it for us</a> if you have an iPhone.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, we did an April Fool&#39;s prank about unicoins.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re making some changes to the Community Wiki system.Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/">There&#39;s a blog post here</a> if you&#39;d rather fast forward through Jay&#39;s explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re also making changes to how protecting questions works, and we&#39;ve <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/changes-and-guidelines-for-the-protected-question-status/">published a set of guidelines</a> for how to use that feature.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That finishes the New Features segment... except for the other new features we&#39;re going to talk about. Breaking news: we&#39;re overhauling the profile page. (Stick with us in this part to hear Joel get bored and start talking about emo kid piercings!) There&#39;s a very outdated mockup <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226177/the-profile-page-is-getting-a-makeover">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then, Joel gets so bored he brings up sports. On purpose. Several times. Also: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Zastava_Yugo_311_1116cc.jpg">this is what a Yugo looks like</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MOVING ON.</strong> The gang invents a new game, and plays it for a while. Could this be a recurring segment? Tune in next week to find out! For now, we&#39;ve killed enough time that Info Security is back online, so we&#39;ll talk about it for a while.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55116/how-exactly-does-the-openssl-tls-heartbeat-heartbleed-exploit-work">How exactly does the OpenSSL TLS heartbeet (Heartbleed) exploit work?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52115/dont-understand-how-my-mums-gmail-account-was-hacked">Don&#39;t understand how my mum&#39;s Gmail account was hacked</a></p></li>

</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast #56 recorded on Thursday, March 6th 2014, aka the 4th of Adar II 5774, aka the second day of Lent. Today&#39;s podcast is sponsored by Patent Trolls of America. Today&#39;s guest is Micah Siegel, Senior Patent Advisor at Stack Exchange and Professor Emeritus at Stanford.</p>

<p>But first, <strong>Community Milestones</strong>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We&#39;ve already talked at length aboutÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/10/podcast-53-lets-go-rio/">The Workplace</a>, but it should be noted that the Workplace community has just graduated. They are now a fully-fledged site, so go check out their design!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://arduino.stackexchange.com/">Arduino</a>Â is our newest public beta site. (An Arduino is a tiny little computer board thing, according to Jay.) We&#39;ve tried it in the past and didn&#39;t have enough activity, but this iteration is looking much stronger and we&#39;re excited to see where it will go. Also,Â <a href="http://day.arduino.cc/">March 29th is Arduino Day</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>At long, long last,Â <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/">Personal Finance &amp; Money</a>Â has graduated. We love money!Â Longtime beleaguered designer Jin finally has assistance on his design team, so we are working through the backlog of graduated site designs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To commemorate Money&#39;s graduation, we&#39;ve made itÂ <strong>Community of the Week</strong>. Here are some of the cool questions we discussed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1625/best-way-to-start-investing-for-a-young-person-just-starting-their-career">Best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/14696/in-a-competitive-market-why-is-movie-theater-popcorn-expensive">In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1767/why-does-gold-have-value">Why does gold have value?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This site grew out of an SE 1.0 site on the same topic, and it&#39;s therefore one of our oldest sites. Check it out!</p>

<p>Next up, we have <strong>New Features</strong>. Or, we don&#39;t, because we haven&#39;t done anything, and David is demoted. Just kidding: we do!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We added the ability toÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/03/your-communities-list-is-now-customizable/">customize your list of communities</a>Â in the top bar switcher.</p></li>
<li><p>We made some tweaks to theÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review">close vote review queue on Stack Overflow</a>Â in an attempt to get it down from approximately nine billion flags. You can also sort by tag (or type of close vote), which you could always do, but now it&#39;s much more visible.Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/223497/lets-burn-down-the-close-queue/">Here&#39;s how it works.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Work is ongoing on our mobile apps, as always. Reminder: you canÂ <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin">download our Android app</a>Â orÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app">sign up to alpha test our iOS app</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay! Let&#39;s talk patents! (Jay loves them, but David says they&#39;re the worst.) It&#39;s been a year since we started theÂ <a href="http://askpatents.com/">Ask Patents</a>Â project. Joel walks us through why we got into this area in the first place, and we fixed the problem. Done. Solved! (Kinda.) It&#39;s confusing, because code is both copyrightable and patentable. About 7% of the patent applications submitted to the USPTO are what we call problematic. We decided to pick out the ones we are most concerned about andÂ <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prior-art-request">post them on the site</a>Â for our communities to peruse and choose prior art. Micah talks through how we chose the patent applications to post, and how it&#39;s been going. (Fun fact: we are the first entity to get a YouTube video accepted as prior art!)</p>

<ul>
<li>By the way, here&#39;s theÂ <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/31/187374157/episode-462-when-patents-hit-the-podcast">Planet Money podcast</a>Â Joel was talking about.</li>
</ul>

<p>We came up with a hack about six months ago to help us make this process scale. Instead of filling out the janky confusing form, we simply started emailing the relevant Ask Patents linkÂ <em>directly to the patent examiner</em>. Magic!</p>

<p>So is it working? We&#39;ve proven as far as we can tell that if we target a bad application and put enough eyes from Stack Overflow on it, we&#39;ll get good prior art. We know how all of the numbers break down: exactly how many people on Stack Overflow have to see the bad software patent in order for us to get enough prior art that enough of it will beÂ <em>good</em>Â enough prior art to trigger an email to the patent examiner.</p>

<p>What can people do right now if they want to make a difference? Go find someÂ <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prior-art-request">prior art requests</a>Â and post prior art to help us destroy some patents. (Also, you can followÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/askpatents">Ask Patents on Twitter</a>.)</p>

<p>Micah is consulting for a few other companies on patent issues, so you canÂ <a href="mailto:msiegel@askpatents.com">contact him</a>Â if your company wants to pick his brain. He knows a lot about the current Supreme Court case that might outlaw software patents altogether (but not for a long time).</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #56, sponsored by the Patent Trolls of America. See you next time!</p>

But first, Community Milestones!


We've already talked at length aboutÂ The Workplace, but it should be noted that the Workplace community has just graduated. They are now a fully-fledged site, so go check out their design!
ArduinoÂ is our newest public beta site. (An Arduino is a tiny little computer board thing, according to Jay.) We've tried it in the past and didn't have enough activity, but this iteration is looking much stronger and we're excited to see where it will go. Also,Â March 29th is Arduino Day.

Next up, we have New Features. Or, we don't, because we haven't done anything, and David is demoted. Just kidding: we do!

Okay! Let's talk patents! (Jay loves them, but David says they're the worst.) It's been a year since we started theÂ Ask PatentsÂ project.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #55, recorded on <del>Friday</del> Thursday the 13th with your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon! Today&#39;s episode is brought to you by the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi">Sochi, Russia</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s been a long time since we last recorded, so we have a lot to talk about, and we&#39;re going to skip most of it. First we&#39;re going to talk about all our brand new sites, so Joel learn about them for the first time.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/">Pets</a> is a site for (you guessed it) pet owners to wonder <a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2202/why-is-my-cat-so-interested-in-me-making-the-bed">why their cats like to watch them making the bed</a>.Â Also, we already talked about this site. Moving on!</li>
<li>We also launched <a href="http://italian.stackexchange.com/">Italian</a>, which is very high quality but unfortunately very slow so far.</li>
<li>Jay thought <a href="http://ebooks.stackexchange.com/">Ebooks</a> would be awful, but it has turned out to be extremely high quality and high engagement.</li>
<li><a href="http://beer.stackexchange.com/">Hooray, beer</a>! Our new Beer site is somehow different from <a href="http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/">Homebrew</a>, soÂ Joel quits.</li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #55, recorded on Friday Thursday the 13th with your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon! Today's episode is brought to you by the city of Sochi, Russia.


It's been a long time since we last recorded, so we have a lot to talk about, and we're going to skip most of it. First we're going to talk about all our brand new sites, so Joel learn about them for the first time.


Pets is a site for (you guessed it) pet owners to wonder why their cats like to watch them making the bed.Â Also, we already talked about this site. Moving on!
We also launched Italian, which is very high quality but unfortunately very slow so far.
Jay thought Ebooks would be awful, but it has turned out to be extremely high quality and high engagement.
Hooray, beer! Our new Beer site is somehow different from Homebrew, soÂ Joel quits.
We launched a Relationships & Dating site, but we broke up with it pretty quickly because it generated too many bad "commitment" jokes (and because the topic was a hard fit for our engine).
We launched a site for software recommendations. And discussed it at length. The good parts version: it's going much better than expected.
We almost forgot to talk aboutÂ Aviation! It launched a while back, and it is a slam dunk for our engine.

It's time for our Site of the Week! (This week was apparently four months long.) Let's talk about Code Golf. It's a site for code golf (unsurprisingly!). Links discussed:


We're no strangers to code golf
Draw the Olympics logo
The Commodore 128 is a thing (though sort of irrelevant to Code Golf).

We already talked at length about the new topbar, but it has bred some interesting changes to other areas of our pages. For example: when we moved Hot Questions out of the MultiCollider and into the sidebar, Code Golf started getting huge boosts on their most interesting questions (as did other sites with broadly interesting topics). Code Golf is seeing 11-15% more answers due to the traffic coming in from other sites via the Hot Questions sidebar. Neat!
So! Let's talk about our most exciting new site: Stack Overflow em PortuguÃªs.Â Localizing our codebase was a dream of ours for a long time, and we finally did it. It's got 1304 perguntas at the time of recording this podcast. (If you want to know more about why we launched a non-English site, check out Jay's blog post.) The public beta so far is one of our most successful launches ever.

<ul>
<li><p>We&#39;ll start out withÂ <strong>Site Milestones</strong>.

<li><p><strong>New Features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The big thing we&#39;re currently working on is the new topbar. It hasn&#39;t changed in years... until now! David walks us through the new features on the upcoming new version.

<li>We finally released our open source status dashboard, Opserver. It&#39;s got all sorts of awesome stuff, andÂ <a href="https://github.com/opserver/Opserver">you can check it out</a>.</li>
<li>We&#39;re still working on our mobile apps for Android and iOS.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Site Milestones</strong>: We launchedÂ <a href="http://astronomy.stackexchange.com/">Astronomy</a>, which is not the same thing as theÂ <a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/">Space Exploration</a>Â site we&#39;d previously launched.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can ask questions about gravity (the force) on Astronomy. You cannot ask questions aboutÂ <em>Gravity</em>Â (the movie).</li>
<li>Astronomy andÂ <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/">Physics</a>Â have a lot of overlap, and that&#39;s okay!</li>
<li>Also, you can&#39;t say Count Dooku in Portuguese. This is an adult-only podcast.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We also launchedÂ <a href="http://tor.stackexchange.com/">Tor</a>, a Q&amp;A site about The Onion Router, a protocol for people who want more privacy and anonymity on the internet. There&#39;s been a lot of press lately about the nefarious deeds you can do thereon, but there are legitimate reasons to use it, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Our last new site is almost definitely not by the NSA:Â <a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/">Pets</a>. The site is doing very well. It&#39;s extremely high-activity so far.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/519/how-much-purring-is-too-much-purring">This is David&#39;s favorite question</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>And now, this week&#39;sÂ <strong>Featured Site</strong>:Â <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/">The Workplace</a>. It&#39;s still in beta, and we don&#39;t usually talk about betas in our featured site segment, but this site is especially interesting because its answers are much less factual than most other sites... and yet it&#39;s still successful.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/9283/how-can-i-tell-people-to-get-to-the-point">Get to the point</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/1963/how-do-i-deal-with-difficult-but-talented-employees">How do I deal with difficult but talented employees?</a>Â is relevant to David&#39;s daily work life.</li>
<li>There&#39;s some good information on workplace transitions. Joel says it&#39;s a self-help group for commiserating. Jay disagrees!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s time to find out everything Gabe knows about Portugal, where he doesn&#39;t live, and has never visited. (Gabe was hired to correct Jay when he calls the language &quot;Brazilian&quot;, or the South American country &quot;Portugal&quot;.)</p></li>
<li><p>He&#39;s been with us for a few months now as our very first Portuguese-speaking community manager as we work on getting Stack Overflow available in other languages.</p></li>
<li><p>So why do we need Stack Overflow in Portuguese? Why not just let everyone speak English? Lots of Brazilian programmers simply don&#39;t speak English, and won&#39;t learn - but while so many of the world&#39;s resources about programming are in English, they&#39;re out in the cold.</p></li>
<li><p>Aside: Joel got a milkshake delivered from Shake Shack, thanks toÂ <a href="http://wunwun.com/">WunWun</a>, which is extremely confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s anÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23539/stack-overflow-in-portuguese">Area 51 proposal</a>Â for the site, and we&#39;ll almost certainly be rolling Stack Overflow in Portuguese out to Area 51 committers first - so check it out if you&#39;re interested.</p></li>

Site Milestones: We launchedÂ Astronomy, which is not the same thing as theÂ Space ExplorationÂ site we'd previously launched.


You can ask questions about gravity (the force) on Astronomy. You cannot ask questions aboutÂ GravityÂ (the movie).
Astronomy andÂ PhysicsÂ have a lot of overlap, and that's okay!
Also, you can't say Count Dooku in Portuguese. This is an adult-only podcast.

We also launchedÂ Tor, a Q&A site about The Onion Router, a protocol for people who want more privacy and anonymity on the internet. There's been a lot of press lately about the nefarious deeds you can do thereon, but there are legitimate reasons to use it, too.
Our last new site is almost definitely not by the NSA:Â Pets. The site is doing very well. It's extremely high-activity so far.


This is David's favorite question.

And now, this week'sÂ Featured Site:Â The Workplace. It's still in beta, and we don't usually talk about betas in our featured site segment, but this site is especially interesting because its answers are much less factual than most other sites... and yet it's still successful.


Get to the point!
How do I deal with difficult but talented employees?Â is relevant to David's daily work life.
There's some good information on workplace transitions. Joel says it's a self-help group for commiserating. Jay disagrees!

It's time to find out everything Gabe knows about Portugal, where he doesn't live, and has never visited. (Gabe was hired to correct Jay when he calls the language "Brazilian", or the South American country "Portugal".)
He's been with us for a few months now as our very first Portuguese-speaking community manager as we work on getting Stack Overflow available in other languages.
So why do we need Stack Overflow in Portuguese? Why not just let everyone speak English? Lots of Brazilian programmers simply don't speak English, and won't learn - but while so many of the world's resources about programming are in English, they're out in the cold.
Aside: Joel got a milkshake delivered from Shake Shack, thanks toÂ WunWun, which is extremely confusing.
There's anÂ Area 51 proposalÂ for the site, and we'll almost certainly be rolling Stack Overflow in Portuguese out to Area 51 committers first - so check it out if you're interested.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #52 with your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton and Jay Hanlon. Today's show is brought to you by Marmite Yeast Extract - you either love it, or hate it! (You probably hate it.) Joining us today are Careers 2.0 Marketing Coordinator Bethany Marzipan, er, Marzewski and Careers 2.0 Product Manager Will Cole.


Site Milestones: Space continues to be all around us, everywhere. It's also a Stack Exchange site, but we've talked about it already.
OurÂ newÂ milestone is Digital Fabrication, which will probably be in public beta by the time this podcast airs. It's about modern iterative manufacturing (3D printing, for example).
New Features: OurÂ Android alphaÂ is continuing, and we now have someone working on the iOS version (but that's a long way away from alpha). Another minor change: we got rid of the automatic downvote from the Community user when a question got closed. Since you no longer have to pay 1 rep to downvote a question, this was no longer really necessary.
Featured Site:Â Skeptics! This is a great example of a site whose community has taken the engine in a very interesting, odd, and wholly successful new direction.


This is Doubting Thomas.
It's sort of like the MythBusters (whoÂ folded a piece of paper eight times)â¦ except better!
Skeptics has rules you can't break: your question must reference aÂ _notable_claim, and the answers must have referenced sources.
Examples:


Will a mother bird abandon her young if touched by a human?
Did people think the Earth was flat?
Is there any evidence of a "mosquito line"?
Do expensive, "premium" speaker cables actually make a difference?


And now we turn to our guests! Let's talk about recruiting programmers. Recruiters are terrible. They make people take down their LinkedIn profiles just to avoid getting messages from headhunters. Our hosts and our guests step through the issues related to recruiting developers, and how to solve them. (Good thing we're working onÂ a way to fix the problem, too! It will be perfect in 6-8 weeks.)
Also, Jeff AtwoodÂ designed a keyboard.
If your employer isn't great at recruiting, have them check out theÂ Careers 2.0 Blog. Bethany and the rest of the team are building up a compendium of great information for hiring employers over there.

Today&#39;s show was brought to you by <a href="http://www.panam.org/">Pan-American World Airways</a>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We kick off the discussion with a topic not on the agendaâ¦ which is reminiscing about who used to prepare the agenda on the old Joel &amp; Jeff podcasts.</p></li>
<li><p>Site Milestones!Â <a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/">Spaaaace</a>Â is now in public beta, so you should check it out. We also closed theÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/40807/india">India</a>Â proposal, after much discussion about the possibilities for location-based sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Five years ago today (7/31) was the start of the Stack Overflow private beta! (It&#39;s also Harry Potter&#39;s birthday.)</p></li>
<li><p>We have a new feature starting this week: featured sites! We&#39;ll grab the most interesting questions from a particular site to highlight the things people might not be aware of. This week, we&#39;re highlightingÂ <a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/">Open Data</a>. &quot;What&#39;s open data, Jay?&quot; Glad you asked! It&#39;s a site for developers and researchers who are trying to use publicly available data to translate it into more functional systems. (<a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/">We make our data available, too</a>.) We were reached out to by the contractor running <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>Â - neat!</p></li>
<li><p>We did a minor feature tweak:Â <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/access-review-queues">a new privilege</a>. At 500 rep, you get access to the Late Answers and First Posts review queues. Congratulations!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re working on an Android app.Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/190200/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-android-app">You can help test it</a>! We&#39;ve started rolling it out to alpha testers. It&#39;s mostly functional - you can view questions, ask, answer, comment, vote, and view your inbox. (Ben wroteÂ <a href="http://balpha.de/2013/07/android-development-what-i-wish-i-had-known-earlier/">a great blog post</a>Â about what he learned while developing for Android - you should read it.)</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s turn to our special guest Jeff Atwood. He&#39;s got many honorifics, and Jay got most of them wrong. Jeff has young children, and our hosts have lots of opinions about child things.</p></li>
<li><p>So! Jeff&#39;s new project isÂ <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. Like Stack Overflow, Discourse was born from the negative experience of having to go to ugly, nonfunctional places on the internetÂ <em>because you have to</em>. Jeff walks us through the process of refining this idea and creating the product and highlights some of its best features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here&#39;sÂ <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/06/forums-are-dead-long-live-forums/">the link to Jeff&#39;s presentation at ForumCon</a>.</li>
<li>Side note: Forums and chat systems are incredibly similar, with one key difference: on a forum, you type in a complete thought. In a chat system, you write in half-clauses, and maybe three or four messages together make a thought.</li>
<li>Discourse is an instant improvement over manyÂ <em>commenting</em>Â systems (as opposed to forum systems). It was never intended to compete withÂ <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, but that&#39;s how BoingBoingÂ <a href="http://bbs.boingboing.net/">is using it</a>Â and it seems to be working well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Jeff isÂ <a href="http://www.discourse.org/buy/">looking for three major partners</a>. He&#39;s got two already. Listen in to hear the Stack Exchange exclusive on the third Discourse partner! (DISCLAIMER: there is no actual announcement.)</p></li>

We kick off the discussion with a topic not on the agendaâ¦ which is reminiscing about who used to prepare the agenda on the old Joel & Jeff podcasts.
Site Milestones!Â SpaaaaceÂ is now in public beta, so you should check it out. We also closed theÂ IndiaÂ proposal, after much discussion about the possibilities for location-based sites.
Five years ago today (7/31) was the start of the Stack Overflow private beta! (It's also Harry Potter's birthday.)

Let's turn to our special guest Jeff Atwood. He's got many honorifics, and Jay got most of them wrong. Jeff has young children, and our hosts have lots of opinions about child things.
So! Jeff's new project isÂ Discourse. Like Stack Overflow, Discourse was born from the negative experience of having to go to ugly, nonfunctional places on the internetÂ because you have to. Jeff walks us through the process of refining this idea and creating the product and highlights some of its best features.


Here'sÂ the link to Jeff's presentation at ForumCon.
Side note: Forums and chat systems are incredibly similar, with one key difference: on a forum, you type in a complete thought. In a chat system, you write in half-clauses, and maybe three or four messages together make a thought.
Discourse is an instant improvement over manyÂ commentingÂ systems (as opposed to forum systems). It was never intended to compete withÂ Disqus, but that's how BoingBoingÂ is using itÂ and it seems to be working well.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">* Â This is podcast #50â¦ sort of. It's the 50th podcast since we switched from the Stack Overflow podcast to the Stack Exchange podcast, but we'll celebrate anyway.


* Â Our most recent blog postÂ [had an instruction in the title](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/07/say-hi-to-nine-of-our-newest-newbies/), and 80 people bothered to do so. Apparently, our blog post titles have power. We probably promise only to use it for good.


* Â Site milestones, featuring Jaydles. Since our last podcast, we have launchedÂ [Space Exploration](http://space.stackexchange.com/). As of this recording it's in private beta, but it may be public by the time of publishing. The activity level is very good - 150 questions in the first few days. 136 of them are even open! (Amusingly, the proposal faced [some promotional setbacks](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/11018/space-exploration-proposal-promotion-deleted-because-of-area-51-connection) during the Area 51 process.)


* New features. We redesigned two small but important pages: theÂ [badges page](http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges)Â and theÂ [privileges page](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges), which used to be extremely confusing. We also fulfilled anÂ [ancient [feature-request]](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/915/165581)Â - you can now retract close votes.


* Jon Ericson is the newest member of the Community Team, and since Community Managers have lots of direct interaction with the community we like to introduce them personally. He's a top user onÂ [Biblical Hermeneutics](http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/68/jon-ericson)Â and we are happy to have him on board.


* Reason #48923 toÂ [work at Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring): we now have two private chefs working for us. They are awesome.


* Also,Â  todayÂ is the rollout of our custom beer pong table. Blame Jay and Michael.


* What is there that's left to say about closing? We made some changes to closing. It's close to our hearts because a) we hate fun, and b) the whole reason that people like us (and also hate us) is because we close all the crap. But people don'tÂ _feel_Â that way about closing. So we needed to learn to close less hatefully.


* Enter:Â [the War of the Closes](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/06/the-war-of-the-closes/). Jay walks us through what changed. Including statistics! And buckets!


* So why do we have to close questions at all? Joel has the answer! Because otherwise we would be like Yahoo! Answers. Joel walks us through the history of programming questions, from the Dark Days. It takes a while. Get comfortable.


* Also,Â [we still hate fun](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/). (If you didn't copy down the question number,Â [this is the question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/953714/face-recognition-library)Â we talk about for a while.) This could be a podcast all on its own.Â [Here's the Meta.Travel.SE question we discuss](http://meta.travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13/localized-questions).Â [Here's the FlyerTalk example thread](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/manufactured-spending/1455542-pin-available-now-visa-mc-prepaid-debit-cards.html)Â Joel was talking about.


* Joel broke the shades in the conference room. Possibly forever. Then, back to close reasons. We realized we couldn't ever cover all of the off topic questions, so there's an "other" free-form reason.

We also have Robert Cartaino, our very own Director of Community Development, here at Stack Exchange, as well as the usual suspects - David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky..Â  Our guest Jorge Castro worksÂ <strong>on</strong>Â Ubuntu,Â <strong>at</strong>Â Canonical. He says to pretend it&#39;s double Os instead of U&#39;s: Ooboontoo. (David, Jay, and Joel workÂ <strong>on</strong>Â Stack Exchange,Â <strong>at</strong>Â Stack Exchange.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So, Jorge! What does a Community Manager at Canonical do? What&#39;s the role, and what does that actually mean day to day?</p></li>
<li><p>At Canonical, the Community Team is a part of theÂ <em>engineering</em>Â department, not the marketing department. They are tasked with doing things that help engineers do their job and help people improve Ubuntu.</p></li>
<li><p>Jorge usually wears pants to work. Usually. The whole team is distributed, and they use IRC, Trello, and Google Hangouts to keep everything moving remotely.</p></li>
<li><p>This is all well and good, but what do community managers actuallyÂ <em>do</em>? Nobody is really sure, either at Canonical or at Stack Exchange. Jorge walks us through the team&#39;s core responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert gives his view on the core role of a Community Manager (by the way, we areÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring/community-manager-telecommute">hiring community managers</a>!)</p></li>
<li><p>Jorge&#39;s team just terminated an experiment with crowdsourcing feature requests and ideas. It was theÂ <a href="http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Brainstorm</a>, and it was originally written by an enthusiast who just kind of decided that it should be done, and Ubuntu picked it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Side note:Â <a href="http://youcanthandletheknuth.com/">You can&#39;t handle the Knuth</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To finish the Brainstorm story, last month it was decided thatâ¦ it wasn&#39;t really working. The barrier to contributing to Ubuntu is getting lower and lower, so people with features to discuss can just show up to the Developer Summit. The moral of the story is that it&#39;s in the process of being shut down, but it&#39;s not ideal to just close all of the communication channels (because sometimesÂ <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video/5941080/windows-7-parody">users have great ideas</a>). We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of crowdsourced feature requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Jay boughtÂ <a href="https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body">this</a>Â last week.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyway. The barrier to participate in Ubuntu is getting lower, so it&#39;s easier to get people_truly_Â involved - instead of halfheartedly participating in the Brainstorm andÂ <em>feeling</em>Â like they&#39;re involved.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://askubuntu.com/">Ask Ubuntu</a>Â is one of our sites! It&#39;s our fourth biggest site by number of questions, with 140k questions, and 3rd for traffic with 231k visits per day. Jorge has been involved with it just about from the start, but he&#39;s not a moderator - justÂ <a href="http://askubuntu.com/users/235/jorge-castro">a 20k user</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One initial problem was the cyclical nature - every time a Ubuntu release came out, there was a flood of new users asking new questions and the answer rate plummeted to the bottom of theÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">list</a>. Then the review queue came and saved the world!</p></li>
<li><p>Jorge has a feature request: custom review queues. He even went through the proper channels andÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/156441/let-the-community-add-a-few-data-queries-to-the-review-queue">proposed it on Meta</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Robert walks us through Community Self-Evaluations. The system picks out a certain number of questions, and the community goes through and gauges whether or not the information available is better than the other information out there on the internet. We discuss it for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>So what&#39;s missing for Ask Ubuntu? What could we build that would make it work better? Jorge says the biggest problem the site is having right now is user confusion about what is a bug report and what&#39;s a configuration issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Â Site launches! As of this recording,Â <a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/">Open Data</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/">Network Engineering</a>Â are in public beta. Go check &#39;em out!</p></li>

News of the day: we're finally in our new office (andÂ podcast studio). We've got hexagonal offices (and therefore crooked hallways), and a cool cafÃ© area. AND HEATED TOILET SEATS. And a kitchen with a giant walk-in refrigerator, for our interns (which we don't have).



Taping podcasts in our new "studio"!


The new office has a nice event space. We've even done an event in it already!
Last week, we had all of the remote developers, sysadmins, community managers, and sysadmins fly into New York to come hang out in the new office. We ate sushi and fried chicken and played a lot of ping pong, and also got some work done.
Originally, we had planned these summits to be our Main Decision-Making Time, which ended up working terribly. We need to be able to make our decisions and do our brainstorming with remote team members regardless of whether or not they're in the office.
Jay, what's happening with the Stack Exchange sites? We closed a couple of small sites -Â ArduinoÂ andÂ Big Data. Everything on Arduino could have been discussed onÂ Electrical EngineeringÂ anyway.
We may have the same problem with Network EngineeringÂ (currently in private beta), but we're more optimistic about that site. Likewise, we shut down Big Data, but currently haveÂ Open DataÂ in private beta. Learn more about why one will survive where the other languished by listening in.
Next topic: do tags belong in titles? Joel: "No." Jay: "You're wrong." (there's a bit more to it)
This is a good discussion! You can weigh in in the podcast comments!
David, do we have any new features? Check out our sites in an incognito window to see some stuff you may have missed.
We'll be debuting the new Help section soon! Previously, we've had all of our FAQ/help/how-to information spread far and wide across the network sites and their metas. No longer!
Also, we're working on some mobile apps. They're vaporware at this point.
Related:Â we're hiring! Devs, front-end developers/designers (which is it?), community managers, sales peopleâ¦ everything.


That's our show! Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #47. See you in two weeks!

Things are a mess over here, not just because we have to remember to stop masticating long enough to talk about podcast things. We're moving offices! The office is full of crates into which we have to pack all our stuff before we move.
The new office is going to be awesome. It has hexagonal offices, and we don't remember if we've talked about this before.
We have three chefs competing to be the chef for the new Stack Exchange office, and it's apparently a very desirable position, because they keep bribing Joel with treats.
What's really going on? Our Tridion site went into public beta. It's different from the one that sounds like Magneto!
For very small and/or very new sites, Joel thinks it might be useful to be able to email opted-in users every time a new question comes in.
Let's talk about the new user homepage, shall we? It's exciting! We've been doing a lot of work about new user experience, and the homepage new users now see will finally be optimized for helping them figure out what to do next.
Meanwhile, our guest has arrived! Welcome, Zuly! She's a moderator on OnStartups as well as a co-founder of Light Point Security, a web security startup that provides malware protection through the use of cloud-based web browsing.
Zuly walks us through some of the history of OnStartups, the things that make the site work really well and ways in which the site could be improved.
So what's the prognosis? Zuly would like to see people get more involved with the community aspect of the site, and with moderation.
Moving on to questions of security. Zuly (and Joel) observe a move in the field of IT Security away from detection and protection against major threats and toward isolation (the Battlestar Galactica defense).
Jay thinks everyone screaming homophobic slurs into Xbox headsets is German. Nobody is completely sure why.
Jay wonders, what about real people? What things should normal people be thinking about in terms of security that most people still don't do?
One other very serious question: Is Zuly's dog cuter than Joel's dog? Dog Talk ensues!
Time to discuss a Meta question: how can we stop premature deletion?


That's a wrap! You've been listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #46 with special guest Zuly Gonzalez and the rest of the regular gang! Join us next time from our brand new podcast studio - it's going to be awesome (but the podcast will still be terrible).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome Back!Â  Our guest today is the one and only Robert Scoble - blogger and video maker extraordinaire.Â  He&#39;s joined by the usual Stack Exchange crew for a packed hour of fun.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Robert is a geek who gets around and meets startups and tech innovators. He&#39;s calling fromÂ <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>&#39;s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Joel wonders if Flipboard is just kind of an echo chamber, but it certainly is not! As with much of the internet, your experience with Flipboard depends on who and what you choose to Follow and Like on your social networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook Graph Search seems cool so far, but you can&#39;t quite yet search for single friends who are Ruby programmers, or programmers at all. (You also can&#39;t do that onÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers</a>, but that&#39;s because you can&#39;t use marital status in hiring decisions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Exchange maintains its own servers instead of hosting all our stuff on Amazon or something. Why? How? We walk through the reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert is writing a book with co-author Shel Israel. (They published another book previously calledÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Conversations-Changing-Businesses-Customers/dp/047174719X">Naked Conversations</a>.) It&#39;s calledÂ <em>Age of Context</em>. The number and quality of sensors and wearable computers and databases and social media activity is increasing wildly these days.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://tempo.ai/">Tempo</a>Â is a smart calendar from the lab that created Siri (and other amazing projects). Apps like Tempo (andÂ <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/">Google Now</a>) are the future of getting you all the information you need before you even know you need it.</p></li>
<li><p>What else is new? Robert is waiting for Google Glasses, and he&#39;s got the<a href="http://www.mybasis.com/">Basis</a>Â watch. Tempo and Mailbox have reservation systems to combat the huge scaling problems that arise when things get tens of thousands of users in the first hour after launch.</p></li>
<li><p>What else is going on? There&#39;s a new Chromebook coming out, but Robert is saving his money for Google Glasses.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple doesn&#39;t have the best-of-breed apps anymore. They don&#39;t have the right software people, and they don&#39;t know enough about us. Is this Tim Cook&#39;s fault? Unclear! Apple&#39;s secrecy is putting it at a disadvantage against the Amazons and the Googles of today.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a user-submitted question!Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/139121/steven-smethurst">Steven</a> who wants to know how many edits a normal answer typically gets.</p></li>
<li><p>By the way, if you want to submit a question for an upcoming podcast, hop over toÂ <a href="http://s.tk/podcastquestions">s.tk/podcastquestions</a>. The best picture of a Siberian Husky gets a t-shirt!</p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s all, folks! You can find Robert as Scobleizer on probably any website in the entire world.Â  Make sure to tune in for the next episode when we have even more fun guests!</p></li>

Alexis is the co-founder ofÂ <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>Â and an investor inÂ <a href="http://hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #43 with Joel Spolsky, Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and special guestÂ <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/">Alexis Ohanian</a>, calling in from theÂ <a href="http://www.tutorspree.com/">Tutorspree</a>Â office. Alexis is the co-founder ofÂ <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>Â and an investor inÂ <a href="http://hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a>. He&#39;s a strong advocate against SOPA and PIPA, and knows how to dress well while doing so, thanks to Joel. (Listen on to figure out what we&#39;re talking about here.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Talking about subreddits: Alexis wanted tags to categorize content coming into Reddit, but his co-founderÂ <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/spez">Steve Huffman</a>Â pushed for subreddits. Alexis tells us why and how it works as well as it does. (Joel hasÂ <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/joel">his own subreddit!</a> And it was the first one ever!)</p></li>
<li><p>Alexis has a book coming out in the fall calledÂ <em>Without Their Permission</em>. &quot;Their&quot; refers to gatekeepers - people who stand between people and access to information. He also has <a href="http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478">another book</a> already out.</p></li>
<li><p>So what&#39;s the next annoying thing that Washington is going to do to stymy innovation? TheÂ <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp">Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement</a>Â is on the horizon. We dive into the wonderful world of software patent law.</p></li>
<li><p>Per Joel: Amazon&#39;s 1-Click is the only thing that should have a patent. Nothing else needs one.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s move on to copyright! Or get distracted and continue talking about patents! Just kidding, we successfully moved on to copyright (and how it relates to wishing someone a joyful anniversary of their birth).</p></li>
<li><p>We also decided that Creative Commons needs to come up with a better open source birthday song. (Also, copyright should not be granted to anything Jay doesn&#39;t like.)</p></li>
<li><p>Moving on: Kickstarter and friends. The connected web is changing the way people make things and sell them to other people who want to experience them. (Alexis Ohanian&#39;s projectÂ <a href="http://breadpig.com/">Breadpig</a>Â is one of the companies leading the charge in this area.)</p></li>
<li><p>Back to Reddit. Alexis walks us through the way Reddit works as a communication platform, and how the team handles &quot;unwanted&quot;, but legal, speech (spoiler alert: they try to avoid censorship). Sometimes you find yourself in the tough position of having to defend reprehensible, but legal, ideas. Sometimes, though,Â <a href="http://jezebel.com/5946643/reddit-users-attempt-to-shame-sikh-woman-get-righteously-schooled">someone can learn something</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, and finally: Alexis was supposed to eat a spoonful of cinnamon on the podcast today. New rule for podcast guests! Alexis says it&#39;s impossible, but he&#39;s discovered that he does indeed have some cinnamon accessible to himâ¦</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See you next week!</p>

David Mamet, apparently. Jay was a drama major.
Michael forgot to pay the Google bill, so our hangouts are back downÂ to 10Â person limits (but it's fixed now!)
We have one big thing to talk about that made a change and generated controversy. Joel correctly guesses what it is: we no longer display your accept rate (the percentage of questions you asked that you accepted an answer for).
The team walks us through this feature's history and the rationale for removing it. (As soon as we shut it off, the temperature in New York plummeted. This is related.)
Enjoy our hilariously awkward pause
Jeff Atwood recommendedÂ replacing the accept rate with some kind of citizenship score. Will this just cause the same problems as the accept rate? How can we get around the problem of ridiculing people for low "citizenship scores"? People will learn how to game anything, after all - remember flag weight?
David wonders why we need a third number at all. We already have your reputation and your badges on your little user card. Those already show how good of a citizen you are.
Finally, this is something we're still looking at, so let us know your thoughts onÂ the meta post.
Site milestones! We have some good ones this week. OurÂ MagentoÂ site went live (not to be confused withÂ Mag_ne_to). This one is remarkable because it's something nobody in the company knows anything about, but it got created anyway.
Congratulations toÂ MathÂ for being the first non-Trilogy site to hit 100,000 questions! Our hosts discuss the Math site and its relationships with other sites on the network for a while.
One more new site to go over:Â English Language Learners. David and Joel don't really understand this site, so Jay tells us what's going on (hint: it's not about an X-Men villain). ELL should help relieve some stress fromÂ English Language and Usage, which was frustrated by the high number of certain types of questions that were coming in.
Is thisÂ podcastÂ the exception that proves the rule?
Another site milestone: we have finally rolled out the final design ofÂ our Travel site. (It was blocked for a while because Joel had strong opinions about the original design.) When you finish listening to this podcast, go toÂ TravelÂ and ask or answer a question!

On to our next topic. We are changing some things with how duplicates work. We want to make it more positive! (It's the [you lucky bastard] close reason.) This is the first closing change, and it's going out in the next week or so.

<ul>
<li><p>So what&#39;s involved in the move? We hired movers to do all the de-racking and truck driving, so the work done by SE employees involved laying everything out and then wiring it back up.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve got all sorts of people underfoot this week who came in from all around the country to work on the new datacenter. Once it&#39;s complete, we&#39;ll fail back over to NY from Oregon,Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/11/se-podcast-36-we-got-hit-by-a-hurricane/">where we&#39;ve been since Hurricane Sandy</a>. There are still some issues to work out before we can do that, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to some of these issues, we are switching over to SQL 2012â¦ tonight! Craver takes us step by step through how we&#39;re going to manage that process.</p></li>
<li><p>So what else are we talking about? How about the new about page! We rolled outÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">a new about page</a>, and you should check it out. Jay and David walk us through it.</p></li>
<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a>Â team got <a href="https://twitter.com/trello/status/291284923606765568">Trello-themed fortune cookies </a>shipped to their office, which is awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>Another feature that went out this week is the ability to upload your own profile picture instead of using Gravatar.Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/01/announcing-a-new-way-to-change-your-profile-picture/">Read about it</a>Â and go upload your picture! (No animated gifs allowed.)</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of animating things, we also think the profile page needs a little simplifying, among other things. (Joel has noticed a few very simplified Q&amp;A copycats cropping up that just have a few of our hallmarks, and missing the in-depth stuff that makes a community.)</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s look at some interesting meta questions!Â <a href="http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/153/is-it-ok-to-ask-for-opinions">Is it okay to ask for opinions</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of questions like that, we&#39;re not completely happy with the &quot;not constructive&quot; close reason. How do we know what kind of questions we want?Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">Good Subjective, Bad Subjective</a>Â helps, but the situation still gets tricky.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the answer determines whether the question was good subjective or bad subjective. There&#39;s a great example of thisÂ <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/78690/white-orange-or-orange-white-which-color-comes-first">on English</a>. (Joel says it was a great question to begin with.)</p></li>
<li><p>As we&#39;ve been investigating closed questions, we&#39;ve found some interesting observations about the process of closing questions and conditioning our users.</p></li>
<li><p>So &quot;too localized&quot; is overused and misused, so we are looking at ways to tweak and improve the closing system so it will be less frustrating but continue teaching new users the things they need to learn about our sites.</p></li>
<li><p>One thing we&#39;re working on is tweaks and improvements to the close and reopen queues. Tune in next podcast for some of the other options we&#39;re considering!</p></li>
<li><p>We talk about the reopen queue for a really long time.Â  Also, close votes have an aging process. David talks us through the problems with it.</p></li>
<li><p>This podcast is now at the top of the close queue.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll see you next week for another exciting episode of..... The Stack Exchange Podcast!</p>

So what's involved in the move? We hired movers to do all the de-racking and truck driving, so the work done by SE employees involved laying everything out and then wiring it back up.

He knows a lot of things about software patent law, so we grabbed him as he walked by the studio to talk to us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;re listening to the Stack Exchange Podcast #40 (We apologize to everyone who expected Wil Wheaton last week)Â  Your hosts are David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky.Â  We also have a surprise special guest: Britton Payne, professor of Copyright, Trademark, and Emerging Technologies at Fordham University. He knows a lot of things about software patent law, so we grabbed him as he walked by the studio to talk to us.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>About 15 years ago, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to create some useful guidelines for the new digital landscape. We talk about what actually happens with the DMCA takedown notices, including loophole issues that Joel has discovered.</p></li>
<li><p>So that&#39;s one part of the DMCA. The other one is anti-circumvention technology, and we go through many of the nuances there.</p></li>
<li><p>So the technological means of anti-circumvention have to be re-evaluated every now and then. New exemptions were announced in October regarding: ebook reading assisted technologies (like Amazon Kindles being able to read aloud to you); jailbreaking phones (not tablets); and unlocking phone handsets (not tablets).</p></li>
<li><p>This has been Copyright Update #1 on the Stack Exchange Podcast, brough to you by Britton Payne!</p></li>
<li><p>So what else is going on in the Stack Exchange universe? We just had a holidays! Part of our celebration includedÂ <a href="http://winterba.sh/">Winter Bash</a>, which ends &quot;today&quot; (at time of recording). You can stillÂ <a href="http://winterba.sh/">check out all the details</a>. Give us your thoughts about itÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/161188/what-do-you-think-of-winter-bash">on Meta</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>â¦including a &quot;hat&quot; that was a tribute to Jason Punyon, who is in a rock (jazz and disco, really) band. They played our holiday party at theÂ <a href="http://hotelonrivington.com/">Hotel Rivington</a>, and they were astonishingly good.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a couple new sites to talk about -Â <a href="http://politics.stackexchange.com/">Politics</a>Â &amp;Â <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com/">Anime</a>. Each has just over 250 questions, so they&#39;re doing okay, for baby sites. We discuss the pitfalls and strengths of each of these new members of our network (especially Politics).</p></li>
<li><p>(Somehow we get onto the topic of theÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hebrew_Israelites">Black Hebrew Israelites</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Politics is a difficult site to approach, but it&#39;s not hard to pass the bar of being better than anything else that&#39;s out there on the internet, and we&#39;re well on our way to doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>We turn to Anime. None of us know very much about anime, but we manage to turn this site into a conversation anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>No news is good news, new-office-wise! Construction is constructioning. We&#39;re moving in March, or so.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a glimmer in Joel&#39;s eye called Stack Overflow TV.Â  They&#39;ll be broadcast live on the Internet on <a href="http://stackoverflow.tv/">stackoverflow.tv</a>, which we will remember to buy before this podcast is published.</p></li>
<li><p>Meth questions! Er, meta questions! First, we tackle &quot;<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/160969/how-to-deal-with-a-highly-voted-non-constructive-question">How to deal with a highly voted non-constructive question</a>&quot;. What&#39;s the problem with the question mentioned there? How do we solve this? We decide to call them &quot;pivot questions&quot;. The conversation leads us to another common type of easy question: &quot;bike shed&quot; questions.</p></li>
<li><p>While we&#39;re here, go follow usÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/stackexchange">on Twitter</a>Â to get the best questions from all of our sites. (It can be a lot to swallow.)</p></li>
<li><p>We experimented with automated twitter feeds and with manually curated twitter feeds, and have found limited success with both. We discuss how twitter feeds (and other types of feeds) work for our company and our sites.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For you people listening at home: We want to take your questions! Go toÂ <a href="http://s.tk/podcastquestions">s.tk/podcastquestions</a>Â to record your question for us to play and answer on the air. You can also send us a written messageâ¦ somehow.</p>

<li><p>Jeremy is the new kid on the block. He started a few weeks ago and is our new resident UX Expert.</p></li>
<li><p>We should have listeners call into theÂ podcastÂ with their questions, like we used to! (This was before Jay&#39;s time.)Â  Go toÂ <a href="http://s.tk/podcastquestions">s.tk/podcastquestions</a>Â to submit an mp3 of your question for next week&#39;sÂ podcast.</p></li>

<li><p>Back to Jeremy. He&#39;s been focusing on the perspective of the new user (including making lots of brand new accounts).

<li><p>We have heard from a lot of people that our site is impossible to log into. Our site is optimized for programmers. A great example: OpenID! We talk about OpenID and OAuth forâ¦ a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example of something that&#39;s a good idea for programmers but confuses everyone else is Gravatar. Gravatar is great if you already have an account, but the experience of trying to upload a picture is too many steps if you have to make a new Gravatar account.</p></li>
<li><p>Do our listeners know how much Jeremy looks like Wil Wheaton?Â  Check out the<a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/team"> Stack Exchange Team</a> page to find out</p></li>
<li><p>News from the dev team! We had two outages this week, totally unrelated to each other. One was ten minutes and the other less than 30 minutes. (Nowhere near as bad as Tumblr&#39;s catastrophe last night!) (Our status blog is on tumblr.) One was a boring hardware failure, and the other one is a result of the fact that we&#39;re starting to outgrow our search solution.</p></li>
<li><p>So we&#39;re investigating other options that will make our search even better (and it&#39;s suddenly urgent)! So a side effect of these outages is that our search will get better. We talk about search for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>So if you&#39;re interested in working on that,Â <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">we&#39;re hiring</a>Â for our New York office, or remotely!</p></li>
<li><p>If you have questions for us, you can go record your question andÂ <a href="http://s.tk/podcastquestions">send it to us</a>!</p></li>

<p>That&#39;s all for this week. See you on ChaCha!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stack Overflow Careers 2.0 is launching in Germany! (Much has happened since the last time we talked about Careers 2.0 on the podcast.)</p></li>
<li><p>So Will, tell us about Careers 2.0! Will gives us an overview about what it is and why it&#39;s awesome. It has two products: job listings and CV search. They are both neato.</p></li>
<li><p>David and Joel discuss the background of why something like Careers 2.0 is necessary: resumes are awful for demonstrating what programmers know and can do.</p></li>
<li><p>We have over 75,000 profiles in the CV search database, which is awesome. If you&#39;re looking to hire a programmer, we have 84,000 that you can have.</p></li>
<li><p>The average old-school big company hiring department has separated the task of finding resumes from the task of hiring candidates, so they are a little confused when they&#39;re told to just check out Stack Overflow Careers 2.0.</p></li>
<li><p>We are trying to take the work and the confusion out of the job of the hiring manager - kind of like a dating service, trying to make employers happy with their candidates and candidates happy with their new companies.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re disrupting the contingency recruiting model, because contingency recruiters&#39; interests are not aligned with employers OR candidates.</p></li>
<li><p>How come this localization took so long, Will? Because it turns out you can&#39;t just go in and replace a bunch of English strings with their German equivalents!</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the site was not originally built with localization in mind, so the project was a little bit painful. Will and David walk us through the challenges the Careers team faced</p></li>
<li><p>Next currencies: bitcoins, and Google Wallet. Joel bought a sweater with Google Wallet, and it&#39;s magical.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/16279/stack-overflow-careers-developer-new-york-stack-exchange">Careers is hiring</a>! Come join us in our new spectacular NYC office that we&#39;ll move into in early 2013. It feels like a boat except it&#39;s on the 27th and 28th floors. So a flying boat.</p></li>
<li><p>We have no other topics to discuss, so we&#39;re going to continue talking about what&#39;s great about working for Stack Exchange. Free food! Cuban health care! Free MetroCards! Gym membership reimbursement! A beach party! We don&#39;t poke people with a sharp stick, and there&#39;s nothing else oppressive, either!</p></li>
<li><p>People wear hats, especially winter-themed hats. Shouldn&#39;t we celebrate all those hats? Definitely! Last year, we ran a project called Hatdash onÂ <a href="http://arqade.com/">our site about video games</a>.. It was a huge hit, so we&#39;re revamping the program this year for all sites that opt in. It will go live on December 19th. Hats!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel teaches us about the nightly news in Israel. It would just run until they ran out of things to talk about, which meant you never knew when anything was going to be on after that.</p></li>

Stack Overflow Careers 2.0 is launching in Germany! (Much has happened since the last time we talked about Careers 2.0 on the podcast.)
So Will, tell us about Careers 2.0! Will gives us an overview about what it is and why it's awesome. It has two products: job listings and CV search. They are both neato.
David and Joel discuss the background of why something like Careers 2.0 is necessary: resumes are awful for demonstrating what programmers know and can do.
We have over 75,000 profiles in the CV search database, which is awesome. If you're looking to hire a programmer, we have 84,000 that you can have.
The average old-school big company hiring department has separated the task of finding resumes from the task of hiring candidates, so they are a little confused when they're told to just check out Stack Overflow Careers 2.0.
We are trying to take the work and the confusion out of the job of the hiring manager - kind of like a dating service, trying to make employers happy with their candidates and candidates happy with their new companies.
We're disrupting the contingency recruiting model, because contingency recruiters' interests are not aligned with employers OR candidates.
How come this localization took so long, Will? Because it turns out you can't just go in and replace a bunch of English strings with their German equivalents!
Also, the site was not originally built with localization in mind, so the project was a little bit painful. Will and David walk us through the challenges the Careers team faced
Next currencies: bitcoins, and Google Wallet. Joel bought a sweater with Google Wallet, and it's magical.
Careers is hiring! Come join us in our new spectacular NYC office that we'll move into in early 2013. It feels like a boat except it's on the 27th and 28th floors. So a flying boat.
We have no other topics to discuss, so we're going to continue talking about what's great about working for Stack Exchange. Free food! Cuban health care! Free MetroCards!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back!Â  We&#39;re actually back to a fairly normal podcast this week and want to bring you back up to speed on Stack Exchange after our adventures the last few weeks.Â  What&#39;s on the agenda? What&#39;s new this week?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back!Â  We&#39;re actually back to a fairly normal podcast this week and want to bring you back up to speed on Stack Exchange after our adventures the last few weeks.Â  What&#39;s on the agenda? What&#39;s new this week?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with the review queue and its new segment: the reopen queue! It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like (the reverse of the close queue). David and Jay walk Joel through the review queue and its features.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the problems with the review queue is people clicking &quot;Looks good&quot; all the way through just so they can get a badge. Who would do such a thing?
[Spoiler alert: We will talk about the review queue for a really long time.]</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally we want to teach you, instead of building something that quietly ignores you when you do something wrong. In certain queues, we use fake review items that catch you when you choose the wrong option.</p></li>
<li><p>There are lots of conversations about this going on on Meta, and we&#39;ll continue to look at the issues and work on solving them so we can fix this part of the game. (Remember flag weight?)</p></li>
<li><p>The other new item on the review queue is the Community Evaluation queue, aka the &quot;Judge Your Site&quot; queue. It&#39;s meant to replace the site self-evaluation meta post, which Joel tells us all about. It&#39;s currently live on Ask Ubuntu and will soon be tested on other sites. Coming soon to a site near you!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com">Money</a> and <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com">OnStartups</a> have very high quality competition, so they are at a disadvantage no matter how dedicated their users are. They&#39;re good sites, but they may be stuck in beta for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example of this is <a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/">Judaism</a>. The answers are all excellent, and the best on the internet on the subject. It&#39;s very small, but it&#39;s growing.</p></li>
<li><p>Sites need to go &quot;beyond the blogs&quot; - to find content that nobody would ever bother to write a blog post about. The Money site can&#39;t compete with all the excellent finance blogs on the internet, so it has to go beyond them.</p></li>
<li><p>People who care about our sites should be focusing on writing great answers that make the internet a truly better place, and not on pleasing every single asker that has a little question.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve only got through one of the things on our list so far. We&#39;ll try one more. Not SSL; it&#39;ll be even more boring, especially for the people who made it this far.</p></li>
<li><p>Also Michael Pryor and his wife just had a baby!</p></li>
<li><p>We beat Hurricane Sandy back with a stick, so we&#39;re having a victory party tonight. (Stack Exchange skipped town, but helped a little bit, so we get to go.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you tune in next week, you&#39;ll hear about hats, our struggles and/or victory with SSL and possible ensuing party, and our victory over the German language.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as you may have heard in the news, the east coast got hit pretty hard by Hurricane Sandy - in particular, our datacenter in Lower Manhattan was almost knocked entirely offline.Â  If not for the incredible efforts of Fog Creek Software, Squarespace, and Peer1 (the datacenter) there would have certainly been days of outages for everyone involved.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a ton of people from Stack, Fog Creek and Squarespace on to tell the CRAZY story of exactly what happened last week! Guests include: <strong>David Fullerton</strong><strong>,</strong> VP Engineering at Stack Exchange; <strong>Geoff Dalgas &amp; Nick Craver</strong>, both core developers at Stack Exchange; <strong>Alex Miller</strong>; <strong>Michael Pryor</strong>; <strong>Mendy Berkowitz</strong>, lead sysadmin for Fog Creek; <strong>Babak Ghaheremanpour</strong>, longtime Creeker; <strong>Anthony Casalena</strong>, CEO and founder ofÂ <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re planning on telling the whole story of Hurricane Sandy - it&#39;s roughly in chronological order here</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are from New York, and all of our offices and equipment are located there. Hurricane Sandy recently hit us, as you may have heard.</p></li>
<li><p>We go back all the way to Monday night, 10/29. Nick got the first communications from Peer1, our datacenter, which was warning everyone that the power was going out for everything south of 34th street.</p></li>
<li><p>Monday night, we thought all was safe in sound. Stack Exchange had some failover plans in place, however, as you heard aboutÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/10/se-podcast-34/">on a previous podcast</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Fog Creek side, things were still relatively calm. They were basically blindsided, because the datacenter was confident that they had generator fuel for &quot;like, days&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the storm hit. There was wind and a little bit of rain. Everything in Zone A got flooded basically immediately, as predicted, but if you didn&#39;t live in Zone A you didn&#39;t really notice.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael Pryor&#39;s foreshadowing. He saw a Hacker News post saying that Internap, another datacenter, was down - and started making plans to protect Fog Creek if Peer1 went down.</p></li>
<li><p>Suddenly, we get word that the generator only has thirty minutes of fuel left.</p></li>
<li><p>Mike Mazzei was the only Peer1 staffer there at the time, and he was stretched pretty thin. He is basically a super hero and ended up saving the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Anthony managed to get exactly one email on Tuesday morning, and it happened to be about running out of fuel in the middle of the day (where he had previously thought they had a few days of fuel to spare).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Let me tell you what it looked like when I showed up.&quot; Michael describes the scene on Broad St. for us.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on flawed information from the NOC, Fog Creek makes plans to shut everything down at 10:45AM.</p></li>
<li><p>Bradford was the only sysadmin who was awake and connected. He said we had to start doing a controlled shutdown</p></li>
<li><p>Mike has the idea that if we can get the fuel up to the generator, we can keep everything online.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone laughs at us for having datacenters in Manhattan, but the clear benefit is that we had the physical ability to make things happen because the employees of the company are close, and downtown Manhattan is a priority to get back up and running, resources-wise.</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday morning was the day where we had the day laborers. Michael noticed that there were people carrying fuel that he didn&#39;t recognize, and then they started carrying our fuel to our tank. Turns out they were day laborers, and they needed payin&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>The system was in place, and it worked - we put a ton of fuel on the roof.Â  At that point, we thought there would be a happy ending.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter Thursday. Anthony wakes up to find that the workers are not allowed in the building.</p></li>
<li><p>The building management and ownership just didn&#39;t understand what a datacenter does. We were &quot;the telco guys&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Things go south with the building management and ownership because of a conflict with the day laborers, because the original company who hired the day laborers didn&#39;t pay them.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone stays quiet and tries to just stay out of the way. Mike Mazzei gets the building manager to let the bucket brigade resume using only the eleven people that were already in the building - no outside help was allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>We were allowed to do this until suddenly we weren&#39;t anymore. Mike gives a &quot;we did all we could&quot; speech and everyone prepares to inform customers that the outage was inevitableâ¦</p></li>
<li><p>More army stories from Joel: the biggest challenge in a crisis situation is the &quot;Fog of War&quot; - 5% good communication and 95% rumor flying around.</p></li>
<li><p>The building finally gets the pump going and fills the header, and then we&#39;re basically okay.</p></li>
<li><p>When Mike Mazzei got frazzled, Joel went ballistic on Peer1 corporate. We discuss how they should have handled the situation and put in more support.</p></li>
<li><p>Another army story! When it hits the fan, you find yourself doing things that have a 1% probability of success, but it&#39;s all you&#39;ve got so you do it anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Â STATUS QUO: Thursday night, the pump gets going. Friday and throughout the weekend, things are calm. Work continues on all the contingency plans, but the situation is more or less stabilized.</p></li>
<li><p>The overarching key is communication, not only internally within your company, but with your customers.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[So as you may have heard in the news, the east coast got hit pretty hard by Hurricane Sandy - in particular, our datacenter in Lower Manhattan was almost knocked entirely offline.Â  If not for the incredible efforts of Fog Creek Software, Squarespace, and Peer1 (the datacenter) there would have certainly been days of outages for everyone involved.

We've got a ton of people from Stack, Fog Creek and Squarespace on to tell the CRAZY story of exactly what happened last week! Guests include: David Fullerton, VP Engineering at Stack Exchange; Geoff Dalgas & Nick Craver, both core developers at Stack Exchange; Alex Miller; Michael Pryor; Mendy Berkowitz, lead sysadmin for Fog Creek; Babak Ghaheremanpour, longtime Creeker; Anthony Casalena, CEO and founder ofÂ Squarespace.

We're planning on telling the whole story of Hurricane Sandy - it's roughly in chronological order here


We are from New York, and all of our offices and equipment are located there. Hurricane Sandy recently hit us, as you may have heard.
We go back all the way to Monday night, 10/29. Nick got the first communications from Peer1, our datacenter, which was warning everyone that the power was going out for everything south of 34th street.
Monday night, we thought all was safe in sound. Stack Exchange had some failover plans in place, however, as you heard aboutÂ on a previous podcast.
On the Fog Creek side, things were still relatively calm. They were basically blindsided, because the datacenter was confident that they had generator fuel for "like, days".
Then the storm hit. There was wind and a little bit of rain. Everything in Zone A got flooded basically immediately, as predicted, but if you didn't live in Zone A you didn't really notice.
Michael Pryor's foreshadowing. He saw a Hacker News post saying that Internap, another datacenter, was down - and started making plans to protect Fog Creek if Peer1 went down.
Suddenly, we get word that the generator only has thirty minutes of fuel left.
Mike Mazzei was the only Peer1 staffer there at the time, and he was stretched pretty thin. He is basically a super hero and ended up saving the day.
Anthony managed to get exactly one email on Tuesday morning, and it happened to be about running out of fuel in the middle of the day (where he had previously thought they had a few days of fuel to spare).
"Let me tell you what it looked like when I showed up." Michael describes the scene on Broad St. for us.
Based on flawed information from the NOC, Fog Creek makes plans to shut everything down at 10:45AM.
Bradford was the only sysadmin who was awake and connected. He said we had to start doing a controlled shutdown
Mike has the idea that if we can get the fuel up to the generator, we can keep everything online.
Someone from Squarespace found empty 55-gallon drums on Craigslist and brought them down to the datacenter. The first attempt is pushing these barrels of diesel up the stairs.
The building's major task was getting the water pumped out of the basement, so at first Fog Creek and Squarespace and Peer1 were able to work on the fuel issue relatively unfettered.
Fog Creek decides to bring their servers back up, since they had people on the ground in the datacenter now to monitor the situation
Â The bucket brigade begins!

Joel tells us about trying to raise the alarm with incommunicado sysadmins Mendy and Sven and get them back online

<ul>
<li><p>What exactly would Scott say that he does here?</p></li>
<li><p>Scott Hanselman runs a podcast that doesn&#39;t waste your timeâ¦ unlike we have for the first nine minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s talk about Scott&#39;s recent presentation at Webstock! Or we&#39;ll talk about how Scott isÂ <strong>not</strong>Â a developer evangelist, despite popular belief. He is a community manager for ASP.net, IIS, anything angle bracket or curly brace related, anything &quot;webby&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>You can buy a single Q-Tip or Lego lightsaber on Amazon. (Most Lego fans don&#39;t like Lego Star Wars.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we have both Programming.SE and Stack Overflow? Joel tells us about the historical reasoning behind it. It&#39;s a party line: Stack Overflow is for things you do at the computer, and Programmers is for things you do at the whiteboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Do people still use Twitter? We thought they&#39;d all moved on to App.net, but that&#39;s only for people who had fifty dollars (that they didn&#39;t spend on the new iPod connector).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Do you realize that you are a biscuit away from turning into Jerry Stiller?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Scott works remotely. Joel inquires: how does he make that work? Scott shares some tips! (Possiblyâ¦Â <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/30TipsForSuccessfulCommunicationAsARemoteWorker.aspx">a blog post</a>?)</p></li>
<li><p>One of Scott&#39;s biggest tips is to use more face-to-face communication instead of text-based. We don&#39;t necessarily agree, and so we explore the topic in depth. Jay agrees, that debates and discussions are not productive in text-based chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Scott will probably teach Computer Science when he retiresâ¦ but then, he&#39;ll be allowed to have an opinion!</p></li>
<li><p>Back on the &quot;working remotely&quot; topic. There&#39;s a difference between being on a distributed team and being the remote person on a not-so-distributed team. The latter is harder! Scott insists on camera at every meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to spend as much as we possibly can on remote collaboration, so we talk about some of the tech you can use to accomplish that.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows 8 is coming out on Friday (or for the past year, if you are a developer or you tried to download it). How is it? Is it awesome, or did someone move everyone&#39;s cheese? Listen in to find outâ¦ and then move on to a general discussion of changing user interfaces and what that does to users who are loyal to companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s talk about something else that isn&#39;t twitter! Scott and Stack Exchange have in common that they provide an audience for answered questions, so Q&amp;A isn&#39;t one-on-one communication. It makes it useful for everyone. Stay tuned for the Joel Theory of Blogging. Is twitter the decline of modern blogging?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel spoke to a bunch of recruiters in London, where he told them that their job is to make the company awesome enough that great candidates come to them. Joel has a lot of projects, remarks Scott, and we discuss them - includingÂ <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a>Â and what makes it great, and Scott&#39;s suggestions for improvement.</p></li>

What exactly would Scott say that he does here?
Scott Hanselman runs a podcast that doesn't waste your timeâ¦ unlike we have for the first nine minutes.
Let's talk about Scott's recent presentation at Webstock! Or we'll talk about how Scott isÂ notÂ a developer evangelist, despite popular belief. He is a community manager for ASP.net, IIS, anything angle bracket or curly brace related, anything "webby".
You can buy a single Q-Tip or Lego lightsaber on Amazon. (Most Lego fans don't like Lego Star Wars.)
Why do we have both Programming.SE and Stack Overflow? Joel tells us about the historical reasoning behind it. It's a party line: Stack Overflow is for things you do at the computer, and Programmers is for things you do at the whiteboard.
Do people still use Twitter? We thought they'd all moved on to App.net, but that's only for people who had fifty dollars (that they didn't spend on the new iPod connector).
"Do you realize that you are a biscuit away from turning into Jerry Stiller?"
Scott works remotely. Joel inquires: how does he make that work? Scott shares some tips! (Possiblyâ¦Â a blog post?)
One of Scott's biggest tips is to use more face-to-face communication instead of text-based. We don't necessarily agree, and so we explore the topic in depth. Jay agrees, that debates and discussions are not productive in text-based chat.
Scott will probably teach Computer Science when he retiresâ¦ but then, he'll be allowed to have an opinion!
Back on the "working remotely" topic. There's a difference between being on a distributed team and being the remote person on a not-so-distributed team. The latter is harder! Scott insists on camera at every meeting.
We want to spend as much as we possibly can on remote collaboration, so we talk about some of the tech you can use to accomplish that.
Windows 8 is coming out on Friday (or for the past year, if you are a developer or you tried to download it). How is it? Is it awesome, or did someone move everyone's cheese?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the show this week are Kyle Brandt and Nick Craver, two SE employees who are heading up our systems upgrades and relocations - they&#39;ll dish all kinds of details on our infrastructure, plus plenty of chat about other mildly relevant things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First up on the agenda: Quantcast! Five minutes before we started recording, we noticed that Quantcast is ranking our network at #100! (or at least we were for a bit)</p></li>
<li><p>If all that additional traffic should cause our New York data center to go down, what will happen, Kyle? Great segue, Joel! We are working on a system for failing over to our datacenter in Corvallis, OR.</p></li>
<li><p>Our New York datacenter is also out of room for us, so we needed to have a failover system in place so the sites could stay up while we move all the equipment to the new datacenter.</p></li>
<li><p>Nick Craver runs at a hundred degrees, no problem. (Extensive conversation about temperature in datacenters ensues.)</p></li>
<li><p>GoogleÂ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/17/3515714/google-data-centers-street-view">opened up its datacenters via Street View</a>, by the way. Cool.</p></li>
<li><p>Now back to more details about the failover. The word &quot;splurt&quot; is used. Eventually Joel lays out the whole process step by step. In the ideal situation, when our failover is planned ahead of time and not due to sudden meteor attack, the whole thing should take between five and fifteen minutes. Afterwards, we come up in read-only mode, at which point someone can manually switch us back into normal mode - or not!</p></li>
<li><p>Nick walks us through the sweet new equipment in the Corvallis datacenter. (How much would you pay for one of our original servers, hand-built and signed by @codinghorror?)</p></li>
<li><p>When we DO fail over to Oregon, the moderators come with us! And they love Stephen King movies! What a segue.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve got a newÂ <a href="http://genealogy.stackexchange.com/">Genealogy site</a>, and it&#39;s hard to spell, but the site is doing really well.Â  There are someÂ <a href="http://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/157/how-should-i-record-sex-change-gender-reassignment">very interesting questions</a>Â on the Genealogy site, about many issues related to genealogy: how to use its software, how to find information, whether to distribute sensitive family information, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Robotics is coming soon! We&#39;ll look back on this launch as the beginning of the end when Skynet becomes self-aware.</p></li>
<li><p>We now segue, awkwardly, to the topic of moderators. We&#39;ve got 275+ moderators.Â  So now we&#39;re discussing the process of removing a moderator, if it&#39;s ever necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to do it in a way to preserve the democracy and is similarly community-driven.Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/151606/handling-calls-to-remove-a-moderator">We asked on Meta</a>Â and got a lot of great feedback. The plan we came up with involved the other democratically-elected mods (and not the company) meeting and putting it to a vote.</p></li>
<li><p>The gang wonders how to remove a Supreme Court Justice. It&#39;s semi-relevant.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tune in next week when we&#39;ll have Scott Hanselman on (for real this time)!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s Back! Welcome to episode #33 of the Stack Exchange podcast.Â  We&#39;ve got a brand new co-host (Jay Hanlon, our new VP of Community Growth) plus our guest this week is David Fullerton, VP of Engineering at Stack Exchange.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So what&#39;s new in the seven months since our last podcast? Check out the new and improved review queue! If you&#39;ve got enough reputation, you can see theÂ reviewÂ button at the top of any Stack Exchange site. The new system is clearer to use and it&#39;s fast thanks to a ton of AJAX goodness.</p></li>
<li><p>From the community side, one of the most important things about the review queue is the First Post queue - a list of the very first post from each brand new user.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also filter the queue, so you can tell it what kind of posts you want to look at - &quot;only duplicates&quot;, for example..</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a badge connected to using the review queue, so people are (naturally) gaming it. There&#39;s an incentive to just go fast instead of thoughtfully helping to improve posts.</p></li>
<li><p>If we add a &quot;reopen&quot; queue, will we then have to add a &quot;reclose&quot; queue?</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re looking at tweaking all of the language surrounding closing questions, including the word &quot;closed&quot; itself. &quot;Not constructive&quot; is itself not constructive feedback. How about &quot;insufficiently objective&quot;? &quot;Poor thinking&quot;? &quot;You&#39;re dumb&quot;? &quot;Subjective&quot;? - but we have such a thing asÂ <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">good subjective</a>. It&#39;s not an easy thing to figure out.</p>

<ul>
<li>(4:07PM - first mention of Taco the Siberian Husky.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Closing questions is on the road to deleting them, but we still have hope for closed questions - or at least for the user who asked the bad question. Closures need to provide feedback to the users who asked the questions, so they have the opportunity to dispute or explain the situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>(4:16PM - first mention of Yahoo! Answers.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Got suggestions for how we re-word the close descriptions?Â <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">Post them on Meta</a>! The one thing that we need to be conveying is that Stack Exchange is a place for expert answers to factual questions, not shopping recommendations or discussion questions.</p></li>
<li><p>So what does Wikipedia do with content like this? Jason Punyon is here, apparently! He&#39;s impressed with the way Wikipedia points out the problems they have with their articles with a big box right at the top. Wikipedia faces many of the same problems we do, with the faceless cabal of &quot;moderators&quot; deleting content at will.</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, let&#39;s talk about something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Bigger picture: how do we teach new people how to use the site? We&#39;re working on a new &quot;About&quot; page! (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">Here&#39;s the old one</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Example: tagging your first question! The current system tells new users they have to give their question at least one tag, but then it won&#39;t let them create a new tag. They have to understand that there is a list of existing tags from which they must choose. (Or we&#39;ll make theÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forests">random forest</a>Â do it for us.)</p></li>
<li><p>So! What&#39;s happened to the company in the last six months?</p></li>
<li><p>We opened a sales office in Denver! We&#39;re expanding our office in London! We hired Jay! Put your profile up onÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers 2.0</a>, because it&#39;s exploding and that&#39;s why we&#39;re hiring salespeople for those two offices (and the NYC one) like crazy!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">We&#39;re hiring a ton</a>. We&#39;re hiring developers forÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/16279/stack-overflow-careers-developer-new-york-stack-exchange">Careers in NYC</a>Â and for the Core Q&amp;A team in NYCÂ <em>or</em> telecommutingÂ <em>or</em>Â hanging out in our sales offices in Denver or London. (The offices and the sales people are very nice. Plus there&#39;s free lunch.)</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re hiring aÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24481/product-designer-stack-exchange">product designer</a>! And aÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/23227/stack-exchange-product-manager-stack-exchange">product manager</a>! And aÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24001/senior-systems-administrator-stack-exchange">senior sysadmin</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re getting a new office in New York City, by the way! If you&#39;ve got enough rep, we&#39;ll give you a lifetime membership to come hang out in our offices now and then.</p></li>
<li><p>So what else has happened? We&#39;ve done some promotions. We&#39;ve got aÂ <a href="http://askpatents.com/">patents site</a>. We&#39;ve got anÂ <a href="http://apptivate.ms/">app development contest with Microsoft</a>Â going, so you can win prizes (including cash) for developing a Windows 8 app. Apptivate.MS. The MS stands for Microsoft or Malaysia or Multiple Sclerosis or Montserrat (it&#39;s the last one) but MicrosoftÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms">uses it the most</a>. (Montserrat is really small and probably has a viceroy.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll see you next week!</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It's Back! Welcome to episode #33 of the Stack Exchange podcast.Â  We've got a brand new co-host (Jay Hanlon, our new VP of Community Growth) plus our guest this week is David Fullerton, VP of Engineering at Stack Exchange.


So what's new in the seven months since our last podcast? Check out the new and improved review queue! If you've got enough reputation, you can see theÂ reviewÂ button at the top of any Stack Exchange site. The new system is clearer to use and it's fast thanks to a ton of AJAX goodness.
From the community side, one of the most important things about the review queue is the First Post queue - a list of the very first post from each brand new user.
You can also filter the queue, so you can tell it what kind of posts you want to look at - "only duplicates", for example..
There's a badge connected to using the review queue, so people are (naturally) gaming it. There's an incentive to just go fast instead of thoughtfully helping to improve posts.
If we add a "reopen" queue, will we then have to add a "reclose" queue?
We're looking at tweaking all of the language surrounding closing questions, including the word "closed" itself. "Not constructive" is itself not constructive feedback. How about "insufficiently objective"? "Poor thinking"? "You're dumb"? "Subjective"? - but we have such a thing asÂ good subjective. It's not an easy thing to figure out.


(4:07PM - first mention of Taco the Siberian Husky.)

Closing questions is on the road to deleting them, but we still have hope for closed questions - or at least for the user who asked the bad question. Closures need to provide feedback to the users who asked the questions, so they have the opportunity to dispute or explain the situation.


(4:16PM - first mention of Yahoo! Answers.)

Got suggestions for how we re-word the close descriptions?Â Post them on Meta! The one thing that we need to be conveying is that Stack Exchange is a place for expert answers to factual questions, not shopping recommendations or discussion questions.
So what does Wikipedia do with content like this? Jason Punyon is here, apparently! He's impressed with the way Wikipedia points out the problems they have with their articles with a big box right at the top. Wikipedia faces many of the same problems we do, with the faceless cabal of "moderators" deleting content at will.
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Bigger picture: how do we teach new people how to use the site? We're working on a new "About" page! (Here's the old one.)
Example: tagging your first question! The current system tells new users they have to give their question at least one tag, but then it won't let them create a new tag. They have to understand that there is a list of existing tags from which they must choose. (Or we'll make theÂ random forestÂ do it for us.)
So! What's happened to the company in the last six months?
We opened a sales office in Denver! We're expanding our office in London! We hired Jay! Put your profile up onÂ Careers 2.0, because it's exploding and that's why we're hiring salespeople for those two offices (and the NYC one) like crazy!
We're hiring a ton. We're hiring developers forÂ Careers in NYCÂ and for the Core Q&A team in NYCÂ or telecommutingÂ orÂ hanging out in our sales offices in Denver or London. (The offices and the sales people are very nice. Plus there's free lunch.)
We're hiring aÂ product designer! And aÂ product manager! And aÂ senior sysadmin!
We're getting a new office in New York City, by the way! If you've got enough rep, we'll give you a lifetime membership to come hang out in our offices now and then.
So what else has happened? We've done some promotions. We've got aÂ patents site. We've got anÂ app development contest with MicrosoftÂ going, so you can win prizes (including cash) for developing a Windows 8 app. Apptivate.MS.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent &quot;REP-OCALYPSE&quot; that happened over the weekend, we thought it was a great time to do another podcast - so come join Joel, Jarrod, and Josh as they talk about some of the recent changes to the site and the motivations behind them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JOEL: This is not necessarily a podcast, but it might turn into something useable, perhaps in the form of a podcast, maybe. The goal is to talk about all of the questions that are getting closed, aka REP-OCALYPSE NOW.</p></li>
<li><p>Part One: there has been closing and deletion of very popular old questions going on lately. Are we happy with how this is going? What are the other options?</p></li>
<li><p>This has come to a head because it got noticed all of a sudden thanks to the global reputation recalc.</p></li>
<li><p>SHOG: This is a perfect storm. Prior to the rep recalc, an SO mod got it in his head that he should go clean up these old popular questions, since they&#39;re totally inappropriate for the current standards of the site. HeÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/122120/the-great-question-deletion-audit-of-2012">posted on MSO</a>Â about it. Then, this rep recalc made a whole bunch of people painfully aware of a bunch of their stuff getting suddenly deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of the stuff that got deleted was worthy of getting deleted. Some were valuable, though, and were worthy of discussion and possible salvation.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: There are a few categories that the lynch mob is after that should stay open (They&#39;re interpreting a particular rule too zealously.) One of these is talking about separate questions that all have the same answer. One of them is three different [identify-this-game] questions that all refer to the same game.</p></li>
<li><p>SHOG: If you ask a bullshit joke question and it gets good answers, great! You broke the &quot;only ask questions you really need the answer to&quot; rule, but the page is now improving the internet. It has value. Good job!</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: An example:Â <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">the center cannot hold</a>. The activity in the answers should be protected, not the questions. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9033/hidden-features-of-c">Hidden features questions</a>Â tend to devolve. They lose value after the top ten or so answers.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: So! There have been a lot of bad questions that were deleted, and some higher quality ones that are hotly contested. So what about programmer cartoons, or boat programming questions? They get a million views. They bring people into the network. Making those pages beÂ <code>Page Not Found</code>Â is violent! It breaks the internet a little!</p></li>
<li><p>SHOG: A theory: this is a lottery. Most of the time you post stuff, and it goes nowhere. Sometimes it strikes a chord, people go crazy over it and generate a great page.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: There are no new questions that this really affects. If somebody asked &quot;what&#39;s your favorite Pascal question&quot; today, it would get closed in a second.</p></li>
<li><p>Eric Lippert wroteÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6445794/865899">a great answer</a>Â a year ago on a question that pissed people off - it was a duplicate and a homework question and all sorts of terrible stuff, but the amazing answer redeemed the question.</p></li>
<li><p>SHOG: We don&#39;t want to encourage people to gamble. We can encourage them to put their money in the bank instead!</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: Back to the question. What is bad about keeping these lottery winner questions around?</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: New example: the programmer cartoons. It benefits us because there are lots of views, and because people laugh! It&#39;s better than googling &quot;programmer cartoons&quot; because we have voting.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: Programmer cartoons questions get closed. So is it okay to keep the weird exceptions around just because they were very successful?</p></li>
<li><p>Concept #1: FamousÂ <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt">RFC about TCP/IP over Pigeon</a>Â that wasn&#39;t serious. Did it break the internet? Did this one not real RFC turn all RFCs into Reddit?</p></li>
<li><p>Concept #2:Â <a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/purim-torah-in-jest">Purim Torah</a>Â on Judaism SE. On Purim, you are required to break rules and get drunk. Purim Torah is a humorous fake discussion of Jewish law that you discuss as if it were serious. The Judaism SE community has decided to allow it during/around the time of Purim. <a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14756/rejecting-others-friend-requests-on-facebook">Some of the questions</a>Â are very funny.</p></li>
<li><p>An example of a &quot;Purim Torah&quot; Stack Overflow question:Â <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-name-of-this-operator">What is the name of this operator: &quot;--&gt;&quot;?</a>. This question wins the lottery! It&#39;s okay that this happens occasionally. Every culture ever has a holiday in which certain rules are relaxed a little. Purim, Halloween, April Fool&#39;s, Thursday, Naked Friday...</p></li>
<li><p>SHOG: Now. Stack Overflow isn&#39;t linear. As it gets older, more and more of these old questions keep cropping up. You don&#39;t need to keep adding funny programmer cartoons to that one question and bumping it up. That&#39;s why we have locking!</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: There is a larger class of questions that we should be discussing. Stuff that&#39;s no longer on topic, but still has amazing answers. For example: career questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Are we on the same page that there exists a class of question that&#39;s awesome enough that it can&#39;t be deleted? What do we do about people who just noticed that their amazing internet artifact was deleted, and they&#39;re mad?</p></li>
<li><p>When frequent flyer miles became a thing, travelers were wary of using them because they didn&#39;t want their number of miles to go down, so they would continue to be treated well by the airline. The airlines realized they had to start printing theirÂ <em>lifetime</em>Â earned miles, so people wouldn&#39;t be afraid of &quot;losing&quot; those miles.</p></li>
<li><p>JARROD: Nick Craver is working on that right now! If you have reputation from something that sticks around for 60 days, the rep &quot;locks in&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: Maybe pageviews should also be taken into account. Another idea: archiving stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>JARROD: Here&#39;sÂ <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/122249/building-an-archive-of-deleted-questions">Pekka&#39;s idea</a>Â about archiving stuff: hosting our own archive of stuff that&#39;s been deleted but shouldn&#39;t go away and become a Page Not Found.</p></li>
<li><p>JOEL: This is not forÂ <em>everything</em>Â that got deleted, or else it would be spam spam spam. But this is for stuff that gets heavily linked to from elsewhere on the internet that we shouldn&#39;t just take away. We&#39;re not ashamed of these questions, this is just part of our history</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well that&#39;s it for this week&#39;s podcast - join us in the coming weeks as we get back into the swing of things and test our new formats.Â  See you soon!</p>

JOEL: This is not necessarily a podcast, but it might turn into something useable, perhaps in the form of a podcast, maybe. The goal is to talk about all of the questions that are getting closed, aka REP-OCALYPSE NOW.
Part One: there has been closing and deletion of very popular old questions going on lately. Are we happy with how this is going? What are the other options?
This has come to a head because it got noticed all of a sudden thanks to the global reputation recalc.
SHOG: This is a perfect storm. Prior to the rep recalc, an SO mod got it in his head that he should go clean up these old popular questions, since they're totally inappropriate for the current standards of the site. HeÂ posted on MSOÂ about it. Then, this rep recalc made a whole bunch of people painfully aware of a bunch of their stuff getting suddenly deleted.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&#39;s time for the final Stack Exchange Podcast featuring Jeff Atwood before he <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/farewell/">rides off into the sunset</a>.Â  Tune in to hear Jeff and Joel reminisce about the origins of Stack Exchange, the journey along the way, and listen to some special recordings from those who have been around since the beginning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel was reading the transcript ofÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2008/04/podcast-1/">Stack Overflow Podcast 001</a>. It&#39;s from April 2008. Listen to the awesome excerpt about the birth of Stack Overflow! (Stack Overflow is not another place to discuss tabs vs. spaces.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What was the biggest thing that surprised you about Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange?</strong>Â Jeff mentions the Meta Issue. Joel started out with a strong antipathy toward meta questions, or discussing the site on the site instead of discussing the topic of the site. It comes down to building the software to accommodate the direction the community goes in.Â  <a href="http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html">You can&#39;t plan everything</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow originally launched without comments, but that was fixed very shortly after launch, because it was something the community needed. Wikipedia hasn&#39;t done this for Talk pages, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re so darn confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>People have recorded nice messages for Jeff in honor of his departure. Geoff Dalgas akaÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/">Valued Associate #00003</a>Â goes first, and his clip is full of win (and <a href="http://www.listology.com/list/vh1s-50-most-awesomely-bad-songsever-50-1">awesomely bad music</a>). Quantcast says we have 20 million visitors a month, and together they could populate a city the size of Seoul, South Korea. We have more people typing on our websites than English Wikipedia.</p></li>
<li><p>Kyle Cronin sent in our next message. He&#39;s an exemplary Stack Exchange user who contributed heavily to the birth of Meta Stack Overflow. Kyle started a meta bulletin board after he found the official UserVoice site inadequate (that is until Jeff decided it was a core business function and made MSO).</p></li>
<li><p>Next up is Josh Heyer aka Shog9, anotherÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/03/welcome-valued-associate-josh-heyer/">Valued Associate</a>Â who speaks very slowly. Jeff had originally put Josh in the same bucket as theÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/52443/welbog">Welbogs</a>Â - people who get bored with chess, so they start flinging the chess pieces everywhere. Stack Overflow and Josh have grown up together. Jeff and Joel found a way to keep users like Josh interested and entertained without being detrimental to the core purpose of the sites, through Meta, Area 51, more sites, and beyond.</p></li>
<li><p>History of the site: Started with Stack Overflow. Then came Server Fault and Super User, which topics were deemed off topic for Stack Overflow, but which were great fits for our audience. Then came Stack Exchange 1.0 and...</p></li>
<li><p>...<a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/06/new-hires-in-new-york/">Valued Associate David Fullerton</a>! He came over from Fog Creek and took the reins for Stack Exchange 1.0... which failed. Luckily, it became clear that the asset is not the software, but the community. EnterÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/04/changes-to-stack-exchange/">Stack Exchange 2.0</a>! Communities were given the power to create new sites, for better or for worse. Theirs is the power to decide whether or not things likeÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2012/02/lets-play-the-guessing-game/">&quot;identify this x&quot;</a>Â questions are helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>There is such a thing asÂ <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/Math/Category.do?cat=Math">sites that harm the internet simply by continuing to exist</a>. For that reason, sometimes sites need to be closed. Facts of life! (Askville is an extreme example. It can&#39;t even hide its bad content, like Reddit can.)</p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;sÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">Jon Skeet</a>, theÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=reputation&amp;filter=all">all-time top user</a>Â on Stack Overflow with more nice comments for Jeff. Jon Skeet is legendary. He has answered 20k questions on Stack Overflow thanks to his long commute to and from work. He exemplifies what makes a great Stack Overflow user, and has been justly rewarded with internet fame, and a ton of reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re almost at Version 3.0 of the core engine. Things are pretty polished, from a software perspective! But software is never really done, especially software that is being built for (and with) a community that&#39;s always changing. So plenty of work remains to be done on the engine, but Jeff is leaving it in very capable hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Information maintenance is a huge problem, especially in the realm of software development, and especially because Google tends to give higher PageRank to older pages. That&#39;s a great way to have outdated information! That&#39;s why Stack Exchange questions are always editable... but the incentive to do so is not always there. (Adding a new question still makes the page better, though, and you get reps!) Editing is a good way to earn your first few points of rep when you&#39;re new to a site.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/88656/eric-lippert">Eric Lippert</a>Â has our next message for Jeff. He demands markup that will make the text on our sites turn purple (becauseÂ <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2012/02/29/the-c-5-0-beta-release-is-now-available.aspx">he writes his blog in purple</a>). Eric uses Stack Overflow to interact with his customers and see what trouble they&#39;re having and how they&#39;re fixing them. (Eric is the Pope of C#.)</p></li>
<li><p>That brings us up to today!</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow is enabling programmers that aren&#39;t located in Silicon Valley-type places to make the greater programming community better and get recognized for their great work, even if they&#39;re just a rote programmer at a regional insurance company.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the final podcast with Jeff &amp; Joel! Jeff&#39;s last thoughts: the new babies are doing well and existing ex-baby Henry is doing well adapting to the young ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Jarrod Dixon,Â <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/">Valued Associate #00002</a>, will play us off.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Well, it's time for the final Stack Exchange Podcast featuring Jeff Atwood before he rides off into the sunset.Â  Tune in to hear Jeff and Joel reminisce about the origins of Stack Exchange, the journey along the way, and listen to some special recordings from those who have been around since the beginning.


Joel was reading the transcript ofÂ Stack Overflow Podcast 001. It's from April 2008. Listen to the awesome excerpt about the birth of Stack Overflow! (Stack Overflow is not another place to discuss tabs vs. spaces.)
What was the biggest thing that surprised you about Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange?Â Jeff mentions the Meta Issue. Joel started out with a strong antipathy toward meta questions, or discussing the site on the site instead of discussing the topic of the site. It comes down to building the software to accommodate the direction the community goes in.Â  You can't plan everything.
Stack Overflow originally launched without comments, but that was fixed very shortly after launch, because it was something the community needed. Wikipedia hasn't done this for Talk pages, and that's why they're so darn confusing.
People have recorded nice messages for Jeff in honor of his departure. Geoff Dalgas akaÂ Valued Associate #00003Â goes first, and his clip is full of win (and awesomely bad music). Quantcast says we have 20 million visitors a month, and together they could populate a city the size of Seoul, South Korea. We have more people typing on our websites than English Wikipedia.
Kyle Cronin sent in our next message. He's an exemplary Stack Exchange user who contributed heavily to the birth of Meta Stack Overflow. Kyle started a meta bulletin board after he found the official UserVoice site inadequate (that is until Jeff decided it was a core business function and made MSO).
Next up is Josh Heyer aka Shog9, anotherÂ Valued AssociateÂ who speaks very slowly. Jeff had originally put Josh in the same bucket as theÂ WelbogsÂ - people who get bored with chess, so they start flinging the chess pieces everywhere. Stack Overflow and Josh have grown up together. Jeff and Joel found a way to keep users like Josh interested and entertained without being detrimental to the core purpose of the sites, through Meta, Area 51, more sites, and beyond.
History of the site: Started with Stack Overflow. Then came Server Fault and Super User, which topics were deemed off topic for Stack Overflow, but which were great fits for our audience. Then came Stack Exchange 1.0 and...
...Valued Associate David Fullerton! He came over from Fog Creek and took the reins for Stack Exchange 1.0... which failed. Luckily, it became clear that the asset is not the software, but the community. EnterÂ Stack Exchange 2.0! Communities were given the power to create new sites, for better or for worse. Theirs is the power to decide whether or not things likeÂ "identify this x"Â questions are helpful.
There is such a thing asÂ sites that harm the internet simply by continuing to exist. For that reason, sometimes sites need to be closed. Facts of life! (Askville is an extreme example. It can't even hide its bad content, like Reddit can.)
Here'sÂ Jon Skeet, theÂ all-time top userÂ on Stack Overflow with more nice comments for Jeff. Jon Skeet is legendary. He has answered 20k questions on Stack Overflow thanks to his long commute to and from work. He exemplifies what makes a great Stack Overflow user, and has been justly rewarded with internet fame, and a ton of reputation.
We're almost at Version 3.0 of the core engine. Things are pretty polished, from a software perspective! But software is never really done, especially software that is being built for (and with) a community that's always changing. So plenty of work remains to be done on the engine, but Jeff is leaving it in very capable hands.
Information maintenance is a huge problem, especially in the realm of software development, and especially because Google tends to give higher PageRank to older pages. That's a great way to ha...]]></itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guests this week are <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/34933/robert-cartaino?tab=accounts">Robert Cartaino</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/60791/rebecca-chernoff?tab=accounts">Rebecca Chernoff</a>. Yeehaw! They&#39;re members of our Community Team.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The original Joel on Software forums were sort of a progenitor for Stack Overflow. They had strict rules: nothing off-topic was allowed - and discussing the forums themselves was off-topic. So a Joel on Software Off-Topic discussion group was created for all of That Stuff. Joel&#39;s forums are still going strong!</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if we let a community go on forever? If it&#39;s stagnating or not really growing, it&#39;s not necessarily making the internetÂ <em>worse</em>. It&#39;s just not doing anything. Right? But think about something like an eHow, that has low quality pages that still rank higher for most queries than other pages with real, good information. The Community Team does evaluations of the quality of sites, but they are beginning to make that process transparent to the communities or even have their communities do the checks. Or potentially to hire really deep experts now and then. Or both?</p></li>
<li><p>What if we have the best site on the web, but it&#39;s for a terrible topic? For example - what if horoscopes.stackexchange.comÂ was the best darn horoscopes site out there. Does the topic still make sense on our engine? This is why proposals are examined so thoughly inÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Area 51</a>Â (and its respectiveÂ <a href="http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/">discussion section</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#39;t checked Area 51 out recently, you should stop by - there are lots of cool improvements that have been made. Robert, Jeff and Rebecca discuss the newfangled Area 51 process, and what sorts of mysterious things happen to a site when it spends its &quot;week&quot; in Private Beta.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes proposals fail and get closed. Game of Go was one of them. It got shut down, but its questions and its users got migrated over toÂ <a href="http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/go">Board Games</a>Â - which is one of the ideal ways to handle having a young site shut down. Another positive way to handle the shutting down of a site is to let its users regroup in Area 51 and try the proposal again with a different approach.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be simpler to just create a catch-all site,Â <a href="http://answers.stackexchange.com/">answers.stackexchange.com</a>, and split off topics as they grow large enough for their own sites?&quot; Basically, there is no way to grow a_community_Â through this method, since all the people there would have nothing in common. A counterexample is the split betweenÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://programmers.com/">Programmers</a>Â - but that wouldn&#39;t have worked with someone just asking a question about hardwood flooring on Stack Overflow and having it turn intoÂ <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/">Home Improvement</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Really good moderation is key to everything. There are 260 moderators on the whole network! We start to identify moderators a few weeks into a site&#39;s private beta by looking for active meta participants, editing to improve content, voting to close - doing activities other than simply asking and answering questions. This doesÂ <em>not</em>Â necessarily mean that the moderators must be the highest-rep users! That&#39;s like asking your grandparents to be ushers at your wedding. Rebecca tells us about the changes that were made to the Stack Overflow election system for the recent moderator election. It involves badges.Â <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/">Learn more about elections</a>! TheÂ <a href="http://android.stackexchange.com/election">Android elections</a>Â are going on now.</p></li>
<li><p>We hold chat-casts with moderators every few weeks to open a channel between the Community Team and the moderators. There&#39;s also a monthlyÂ <a href="http://modnewsletter.stackexchange.com/">moderator newsletter</a>Â with highlights of important announcements. That&#39;s so people can get the 5-6 things they need to know without having to be too deeply ingrained in the moderators&#39; chat room or in metas.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">Meta Stack Overflow</a>Â is to the federal government as individual site metas are to state governments. It&#39;s possible to spend most of your time on your local site government, and the newsletter will keep you apprised of the changes on the national level.</p></li>
<li><p>Moderation and meta activity are huge parts of why Stack Exchange is so awesome, but we can&#39;t forget that it&#39;s the amazing Q&amp;A engine that makes all that awesomeness possible!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it for Podcast #30, which is it for podcasts in 2011. See you next year!</p>

<li><p>Canvas is re-imagining a message board, because the aesthetic of forums hasn&#39;t changed in a very long time. It&#39;s got a focus on remixing and collaborating images.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s similar to 4chan but interestingly, Canvas requires users to authenticate their login using Facebook to deter trolls, but still allows pseudonymous and anonymous posting.</p></li>

<li><p>Its a fast way to get a message out to thousands of people because every post starts out as position zero on page zero.

(See theÂ <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19">Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>A long, long time ago... people tried to sue telephone companies for allowing calls in which illegal things were discussed. That was ridiculous, and the phone companies were ruled to have no liability for how their channel is used. That&#39;s the precedent that the internet operates on today.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel describes the current provisions outlined in the DMCA that give copyright holders and websites ways to enforce copyright in a fair way that punishes only the infringer, not the website.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s demonstrative of the fact that Congress is run by corporations currently; the only things that gets passed are things that companies want passed. Example:Â <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pizza-is-a-vegetable">pizza is a vegetable</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://spanish.stackexchange.com/">Spanish</a>Â site is live! It&#39;s sort of strange having a site about learning one language be conducted in another. With <a href="http://french.stackexchange.com/">French</a>Â we decided to let them try to conduct the whole site in French. It&#39;s an experiment!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/">Gaming</a>Â is having aÂ <a href="http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/3203/can-i-see-public-data-about-visits-and-page-views-for-gaming">meteoric rise</a>Â due to Skyrim. Check out theÂ <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lme7k.png">graphs</a>! (Here they are in the show notes!) Skyrim questions have 1.35 million views in ten days, at time of recording. Whoa! Thanks toÂ <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/23/badp">badp</a> for posting.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyway!Â <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/brento">Brent Ozar</a>Â is our special guest today! He is a SQL Server Master. He has aÂ <a href="http://brentozar.com/">blog</a>. He has a talk about SQL tuning and whether or not you should even do it. He summarizes it for us, and the gang talks about SQL tuning, caching, load sharing. XML shredding. You know. Database stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>At Stack Exchange, and especially with Stack Overflow Careers, we are trying to elevate users and show off how awesome they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s been reading up on all the Wikipedia pages on personality disorders. Most executives, especially at startups, are indistinguishable from people in insane asylums, apparently. Paranoia is a particularly common form of mental illness among executives.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Jeff & Joel are joined this week by Brent Ozar, database wizard who has helped tons of companies (including Stack) with their massive scaling needs.


TheÂ SpanishÂ site is live! It's sort of strange having a site about learning one language be conducted in another. With FrenchÂ we decided to let them try to conduct the whole site in French. It's an experiment!
GamingÂ is having aÂ meteoric riseÂ due to Skyrim. Check out theÂ graphs! (Here they are in the show notes!) Skyrim questions have 1.35 million views in ten days, at time of recording. Whoa! Thanks toÂ badp for posting.
Anyway!Â Brent OzarÂ is our special guest today! He is a SQL Server Master. He has aÂ blog. He has a talk about SQL tuning and whether or not you should even do it. He summarizes it for us, and the gang talks about SQL tuning, caching, load sharing. XML shredding. You know. Database stuff.
At Stack Exchange, and especially with Stack Overflow Careers, we are trying to elevate users and show off how awesome they are.
Joel's been reading up on all the Wikipedia pages on personality disorders. Most executives, especially at startups, are indistinguishable from people in insane asylums, apparently. Paranoia is a particularly common form of mental illness among executives. This is relevant because people often say they won't send employees to a Stack Overflow event because they'll get poached! (But it's probably true.)
Feel free to poach Jason Punyon, employers. (Scratch "Punyon" off your Podcast Bingo card.)
There's a post on theÂ Server Fault blog about why Stack Exchange isn't in the cloud. It's got a nice discussion about the pros and cons of letting somebody else host your stuff, which the gang explores.

He &quot;invented&quot; (well, pioneered, really) theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">XML-RPC protocol</a>. Dave tells us the story of how and why the protocol came to be.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Right now, Dave&#39;s working on a &quot;magnificent symphony of software&quot; - it&#39;s the communication system he wants to use. It involves a minimal blogging tool with only RSS output (plus a dongle that will push the RSS to twitter, etc), a &quot;River of News&quot; aggregator, and an overarching tool for creating content that can be picked apart and included on other platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave&#39;s philosophy is that some time soon, users are going to realize that they need a place to build and control their content before they post it to any service or platform that&#39;s controlled by an outside company.</p></li>
<li><p>The gang discusses the nature of comments on blogs (and on Stack Exchange questions and answers), and how to manage them - or whether to allow them at all. It leads to a discussion of creating new pages on Wikipedia, and its requirements for citations and notoriety.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave suggests putting together a Best Practices manual on managing your content on the web. He suggests that having as few domain names as possible will help people not lose their content (or break all their links). Jeff suggests that Facebook can be that sort of &quot;repository&quot; for many people, but Dave disagrees. (<em>n.b.</em>: He recently deleted his Facebook account.) Companies don&#39;t necessarily last forever - we&#39;re looking at you,Â <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/09/developer-turns-geocities-archive-into-a-digital-pompeii/">Geocities</a>. (Talk of Facebook inevitably pushes the discussion into the realm of what information websites record, and how, and why - generally as related to advertising.)</p></li>
<li><p>Services like FedEx and UPS can get you your new Kindle Fire on release day because they&#39;ve cut every possible corner - except for the 1% of people who are not a simple case because they&#39;ve moved, or they need their package on time. That 1% outlier idea can&#39;t be applied to freedom (intellectual, personal, what have you), Dave says.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave wants to buy a bland, uninvolved service that does nothing but provide the service it says it provides. Amazon was doing a great job of that until they kicked WikiLeaks off their storage. Dave is overlooking that incident for now because there is nowhere else to go that provides the whole package (uptime, reliability, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Dave wrote aÂ <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/willUsersAlwaysBeUsers.html">blog post</a>Â involving the quote: &quot;If you&#39;re not paying for something, you have no reason to expect it to be there tomorrow.&quot; But does that mean that because youÂ <em>are</em>Â paying for something, you_can_Â expect it to be there tomorrow? The gang explores this philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>Suddenly we&#39;re talking about how Dave believes there is no real hard line between government and business... an issue which cannot necessarily be solved in a 60-minute podcast.</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter solves the subscription process that RSS has. With RSS, you have to go through a bunch of steps to get yourself subscribed. With Twitter, you just have to click one &quot;follow&quot; button, and you&#39;re set.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel is considering writing fiction! He likes the medium because you don&#39;t have to tell the truth. You tell the deeper truth by manipulating the superficial facts.</p></li>
<li><p>The coalition of the users doing stuff together independent of Facebook or Google or what have you is valuable and should be encouraged and protected. It&#39;s a conversation that Jeff and Dave will continue offline.</p></li>
<li><p>You can find Dave atÂ <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, and you should also check outÂ <a href="http://poets.scripting.com/">EC2 for Poets</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Stack Overflow is accepting nominations for moderators for the next 6 days (at time of recording). So far, the<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election"> nominations</a> areÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/Aurimas/status/133823246884798465">civil and intelligent</a> (unlike in the real world of course).

<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/">Gaming Stack Exchange</a>Â is having aÂ <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/">massive competition</a>Â in honor of the launches of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. We want to see which game gets the most views on the site in the week after it was released. There areÂ <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/prizes">sweet prizes</a>! Jeff will be shocked if Call of Duty wins this particular contest. David thinks Skyrim is going to win, too. It seems that many people feel this way. Can Call of DutyÂ <a href="http://blog.gaming.stackexchange.com/2011/11/does-modern-warfare-3-need-a-medic/">pull it off</a>? Maybe, if we discover The One Question that gets a million views from Google.</p>

<ul>
<li>Also, we&#39;re having a launch party on Friday! If you&#39;re a gamer in New York and you want to come, send an email toÂ <a href="mailto:team+gaming@stackexchange.com">team+gaming@stackexchange.com</a>! We will also be livestreaming the party, where there will be 10 consoles playing MW3 and Skyrim. Stack Exchange and Fog Creek employees will be playing games, having snacks, and asking and answering great questions on the site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>Â for the first Modern Warfare game: it&#39;s a video game where you die! In the campaign story, you die. You have to, and there&#39;s no way around it. You die! That&#39;s sort of rare.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Jeff is off to the airport! Go see him atÂ <a href="http://oredev.org/2011">_Ã_redev</a>!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week&#39;s guest is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich">Mark Russinovich</a>, from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals">SysInternals.com</a> and now with Microsoft.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#39;s guest is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich">Mark Russinovich</a>, from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals">SysInternals.com</a> and now with Microsoft.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chatrooms are chaotic! Jeff mentions that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">lots of spaces</a> need editorial oversight. A lot of good information is available, but it&#39;s a hard to find it in the disorganizations. It&#39;s a chronic problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Mark and Joel talk about his command-line work. Mark had to reverse-engineer this stuff, almost from scratch. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE">SoftICE</a> was effectively a device driver that took control away from the OS, when it was active. Mark&#39;s become famous for being a Microsoft hacker (yes they exist) and for his work with rootkits, the problems with which are becoming an epidemic.</p></li>
<li><p>Mark started outside of Microsoft, but later his company was acquired by them. He&#39;s worked on Vista, Windows 7, and a bit of Windows 8, but is now on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Services_Platform">Windows Azure</a>. For Azure, an OS for data centers, Mark works for the fabric controller team. Like the kernel in Windows, this defines processes and consumes application xml. Basically, he&#39;s all up and down the stack. One of their biggest concerns is upping consistency, to make Azure the best in the industry.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the project&#39;s other goals is to have a virtual machine deploy in less than 5 minutes, and update in 2 minutes or less. Right now, those times are 8-9 minutes at the 50th percentile. They&#39;re pursuing a variety of tactics to optimize the boot process. There are lots of moving parts to optimize. It&#39;s a fun project, and it&#39;s all new.</p></li>
<li><p>Not that many companies can deploy a cloud operating system at such a scale. Investment is expensive, although, as Jeff points out, machines today are more powerful than ever before. Still, although <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc">Stack Overflow is ranked #180</a>, getting to #150 requires four times the traffic. Mark points out that yes, you can manage the servers yourself, make the investment, figure out all the parts, and so forth. Or, in nine minutes, you can upload your webapp to the cloud and pay only for what you use.</p></li>
<li><p>The cloud is best for companies who have traffic in bursts and periodic traffic. Companies where, say, there&#39;s a known holiday shopping rush or other specific types of workload patterns. By contrast, Stack Overflow&#39;s traffic is weirdly predictable. Mark notes that the other benefit to cloud computing is replication; if a disk fails (as 3-5% of them do annually) your data is cloned across the country.</p></li>
<li><p>Mark wrote a novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Day-Novel-Mark-Russinovich/dp/031261246X%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIIBINOD46VC3JCLQ%26tag%3Dstackoverfl08-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D031261246X">Zero Day</a>, which was published in March. It&#39;s a cyber thriller based around a cyber terrorism plot to bring down parts of the world using malware. It&#39;s readable and got lots of verisimillitude. The sequel, <em>Trojan Horse</em> is set to come out next fall.</p></li>
<li><p>Right now, while direct attacks are less common, spear-phishing (targeted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> attacks) and good old exploitation of vulnerabilities in a system are still serious threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff talks about the back-and-forth about putting anti-virus software on our servers. On the one hand, it&#39;s absolutely necessary, especially as Careers 2.0 has users uploading resumes and CVs onto the server. On the other hand, <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2751/the-myths-about-viruses-in-unix-linux">mention &quot;anti-virus&quot; in a Linux room</a> and be prepared to get laughed out. There&#39;s also a serious performance question there.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week's guest is Mark Russinovich, from SysInternals.com and now with Microsoft.


Chatrooms are chaotic! Jeff mentions that lots of spaces need editorial oversight. A lot of good information is available, but it's a hard to find it in the disorganizations. It's a chronic problem.
Mark and Joel talk about his command-line work. Mark had to reverse-engineer this stuff, almost from scratch. SoftICE was effectively a device driver that took control away from the OS, when it was active. Mark's become famous for being a Microsoft hacker (yes they exist) and for his work with rootkits, the problems with which are becoming an epidemic.
Mark started outside of Microsoft, but later his company was acquired by them. He's worked on Vista, Windows 7, and a bit of Windows 8, but is now on Windows Azure. For Azure, an OS for data centers, Mark works for the fabric controller team. Like the kernel in Windows, this defines processes and consumes application xml. Basically, he's all up and down the stack. One of their biggest concerns is upping consistency, to make Azure the best in the industry.
One of the project's other goals is to have a virtual machine deploy in less than 5 minutes, and update in 2 minutes or less. Right now, those times are 8-9 minutes at the 50th percentile. They're pursuing a variety of tactics to optimize the boot process. There are lots of moving parts to optimize. It's a fun project, and it's all new.
Not that many companies can deploy a cloud operating system at such a scale. Investment is expensive, although, as Jeff points out, machines today are more powerful than ever before. Still, although Stack Overflow is ranked #180, getting to #150 requires four times the traffic. Mark points out that yes, you can manage the servers yourself, make the investment, figure out all the parts, and so forth. Or, in nine minutes, you can upload your webapp to the cloud and pay only for what you use.
The cloud is best for companies who have traffic in bursts and periodic traffic. Companies where, say, there's a known holiday shopping rush or other specific types of workload patterns. By contrast, Stack Overflow's traffic is weirdly predictable. Mark notes that the other benefit to cloud computing is replication; if a disk fails (as 3-5% of them do annually) your data is cloned across the country.
Mark wrote a novel: Zero Day, which was published in March. It's a cyber thriller based around a cyber terrorism plot to bring down parts of the world using malware. It's readable and got lots of verisimillitude. The sequel, Trojan Horse is set to come out next fall.
Right now, while direct attacks are less common, spear-phishing (targeted phishing attacks) and good old exploitation of vulnerabilities in a system are still serious threats.
Jeff talks about the back-and-forth about putting anti-virus software on our servers. On the one hand, it's absolutely necessary, especially as Careers 2.0 has users uploading resumes and CVs onto the server. On the other hand, mention "anti-virus" in a Linux room and be prepared to get laughed out. There's also a serious performance question there.
Everyone should go implement 2-step verification on their email accounts (Gmail account!) right now. Well? Go! Do it now! We'll wait.
Mark says he would separate his password into tiers, with the top tier being ecommerce sites. Jeff says that this is part of why he's been pushing for third-party sign-ins, where the third party isn't a bunch of idiots. Mark believes we are converging towards this naturally, with the proliferation of Google and Facebook sign-ins.
Joel wonders if maybe there just aren't that many malevolent people in the world. Mark quickly counters with Facebook's admission that 600k logins are compromised daily.
He also points out that while our security is better (compare XP to Vista or 7's security hardening) the attacks are more sophisticated than ever. Just look at Stuxnet.

<li><p>Eric wants to convince Jeff and Joel not to batch deploy anymore. (We deploy multiple times per day.

The discussion about the way the teams deploy changes leads to a discussion about unit testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s criticism of lean startups: the combination of Lean Startups and the fact that any startup can get a huge amount of funding instantly leads to a lot of startups that seem to &quot;pivot&quot; an awful lot.Â <a href="http://www.color.com/#landing">Color</a>Â is a classic example of this. Eric reminds us that<a href="http://www.g33kpron.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Eddard-Stark-the-Weather.jpg">winter is coming</a>Â for entrepreneurship, and this might not be a problem much longer.</p></li>

<li><p>Eric is Mr. Pivot, so let&#39;s get back to that: Pivoting is not necessarily a mistake.

ANYWAY.Â Eric RiesÂ is our guest today! He's got a new book out calledÂ The Lean Startup. What is a Lean Startup? It's an analogy to lean manufacturing: a system of management about fast cycle time and building quality in from the beginning. Lean startups take those techniques and apply them to startups, where there are a lot more unknowns about the product and the customer.
Eric wants to convince Jeff and Joel not to batch deploy anymore. (We deploy multiple times per day. We have at least one per day, and other than that people can deploy as they see that they need to.) The discussion about the way the teams deploy changes leads to a discussion about unit testing.

What is a pivot? A change in strategy without a change in vision. The key to the analogy is that in a pivot, one foot stays planted while you shift around to a new direction.
Innovation accounting is Eric's alternate accounting system that's designed to tell if you're getting close to product market fit. ROI, profitability, growth rates - all the traditional accounting metrics don't apply at the really early stages of a startup.
Joel's dream for the Stack Exchange Network is medical research. The problem is getting a critical mass of people together to make the site work. Currently, we branch into other verticals via "overlapping circles" - starting out with programmers who also have other hobbies.

<li><p>James Portnow is joining us!Â <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/show/extra-credits">Extra Credits</a>Â has been a thing for a few years.

<li><p>Extra Credits did an episode about gaming addiction, which is related to the reason for the reputation cap on Stack Exchange sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Exchange has sites forÂ <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/">gamers</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/">game developers</a>! The Game Development site is distinct from Stack Overflow because developing a game is a bigger set of activities than just writing code.</p></li>
<li><p>Gamification is a way to get users to &quot;read the manual&quot;, and get them to the point where they don&#39;t need the gamification aspects anymore at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Games like Simon and Dragon&#39;s Lair don&#39;t give you any choice or control. Games provide positive simulation in various ways - by feeling like you&#39;re acquiring a skill, by keeping things neat in Tetris, or on Stack Exchange, seeing somebody vote up something you wrote.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.awkwardsilence.co.uk/OneChance.html">One Chance</a>Â is a flash game with an interesting mechanic: it leaves a cookie that prevents you from playing the game again. It&#39;s an interesting concept on the bleeding edge of game design.</p></li>
<li><p>The dark side of gamification... is conditioned actions that make players continue to play FarmVille, slot machines, some MMOs, etc. Players become aware that they are not enjoying the experience, but they are compelled to continue nonetheless.</p></li>
<li><p>The danger in theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy">Khan Academy</a>Â is that for the American education system, this is the way to reduce our budget: have people record videos and have other people learn via these gamified websites.

A high sense of agency is the sense of having control over your own existence and the world around you. When a student falls behind a little bit and does not feel like he or she can catch back up, they lose their sense of agency, and it becomes a monumental task to get the student back on track. Games teach us that outcome is directly related to our own actions, but with more instant results. (Programming is another way to demonstrate this direct impact.)</p></li>
<li><p>Joel peeled hard boiled eggs in the Israeli Army, so you can cross that off your Podcast Bingo card.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel (but no Jeff) is joined this week by <a href="http://paulbiggar.com/research/">Paul Biggar</a> (who Joel originally met when he was a DevDays London 2009 speaker about scripting languages).Â  Paul currently works at Mozilla, having come off his own (not that successful) Y Combinator startup.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paul&#39;s least favorite scripting language of all time is PHP. Paul works in static analysis, which is looking at a program that is not running, and making decisions about whether or not it will work, how to make it faster, what the security implications are. Paul has solved theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>...Â <em>twice</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>PHP stinks, so we talk about C and C++ for a while. Bjarne Stroustrup wroteÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Evolution-C-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0201543303%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIIBINOD46VC3JCLQ%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0201543303">a great book</a>Â on the topic.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Joel (but no Jeff) is joined this week by Paul Biggar (who Joel originally met when he was a DevDays London 2009 speaker about scripting languages).Â  Paul currently works at Mozilla, having come off his own (not that successful) Y Combinator startup.


Paul's least favorite scripting language of all time is PHP. Paul works in static analysis, which is looking at a program that is not running, and making decisions about whether or not it will work, how to make it faster, what the security implications are. Paul has solved theÂ Halting Problem...Â twice.
PHP stinks, so we talk about C and C++ for a while. Bjarne Stroustrup wroteÂ a great bookÂ on the topic.
The people who love language design are not the people that are enthused by PHP, and they were scared off by the "poisonous community" (Paul's words!). The most popular programming languages that aren't very well designed: PHP, Perl, JavaScript, shell. Their creators "had no business designing languages". How did they become popular?
HaskellÂ was a programming language that was well-designed but never gained any traction. Paul says there are two types of programming languages: those that start safe and try to build performance, and those that start performing well and try to build safety in. Haskell is the former. It "escaped" from academia... barely. F# comes from the same school of thought.
What aboutÂ Dart)? Google released a spec. They've got a full implementation that's ready to go in Chrome.
The cool kids are usingÂ MongoDB,Â CoffeeScript, andÂ tortoise shell glasses.
Enough about programing languages! Paul started a YC journalism startup called NewsTilt. It was the Future of Journalism, which is a terrible business to get into.Â Here's why it got shut down. In a nutshell: there were problems with the product, and problems with communication between Paul and his co-founder. Also, not being in Silicon Valley can be problematic... though Silicon Valley is not necessarily the be-all end-all of startup success. Perhaps most important was that it didn't solve a problem Paul really cared about.
Circle CIÂ is a compiler-related startup thatÂ doesÂ capture Paul's interest. It's "continuous integration made easy"!
Paul didn't actually make the slides for his talk. But the message he wants to get out there is that working on compilers is actually very easy, and not something only wizards can do.
Paul can be found on Twitter @PaulBiggar, and atÂ PaulBiggar.com.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Jeff &amp; Joel are joined (in studio, no less) by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/91687/david-fullerton">David Fullerton</a>, head of the NY Dev Department, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/6212/jason-punyon">Jason Punyon</a>, a developer here in the office.Â  Its a fast moving discussion covering all kinds of topics, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stack Exchange 1.0 (which gave users wanting their own Q&amp;A site the Stack Exchange software, without being official Stack sites) is touched on. Jeff discusses the clones that exist and their reason for existing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://trello.com/">Trelloâs</a>Â launch caused some kerfuffle onÂ <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/">Web Apps.SE</a>Â when general (and off-topic) help questions started being asked. In the larger sense, they discuss the necessity of applications and products to have their own unique help service.</p></li>
<li><p>Some recent changes made toÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Area 51</a>Â are discussed, including the restructured voting system for example questions. Joel discusses the problems that arose out of the previous method of judging example questions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/5/fabian">Fabian</a>Â asks about overlapping proposals on Area 51, and David gives an overview of the process that goes along with the decision to merge proposals. Joel admits they arenât too good at judging whether or not proposals are the right size.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel gives a call to arms for Area 51! They discuss the soon-to-launchÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1817/biblical-hermeneutics">Biblical Hermeneutics</a>Â site and its relationship to the existingÂ <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/">Christianity</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/">Judaism</a>Â sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff brings up some other sites on Area 51, includingÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/10919/lego">LEGO</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/164/firearms">Firearms</a>. The validity of aÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6433/healthcare-it">Healthcare IT</a>Â site is discussed.</p></li>
<li><p>Alex just access to Stack Exchangeâs real-timeÂ <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, so the traffic trends of the site are discussed.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff plugs one of his pet proposals, and others discuss theirs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a>Â does indeed pop up).</p></li>
<li><p>Joel shifts the conversation over toÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers</a>. You can visit Joelâs profileÂ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/spolsky">here</a>! Careers and Stack Overflow arenât integrated as well as they should be, and solutions to that are discussed. Jeff and David also talk about cool updates coming to Careers. On a sidenote, if youâve ever wondered what itâs like to be an intern for Fog Creek, youâre in luck! David talks about that experience briefly.</p></li>
<li><p>Careersâ relationship withÂ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linked In</a>Â is mentioned and spurs on a wider discussion about the other career site.</p></li>
<li><p>The history of Careersâ filter is discussed, including how it ran originally and how it runs now.</p></li>
<li><p>Notifications on Stack Overflow have been modified recently. Jeff goes into the depth about how this was brought about. The term âyak-shavingâ is involved.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion aboutÂ parenting questions on other Q&amp;A sites reminds Jeff of a recent discussion onÂ <a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/">Parenting.SE</a>, regarding the horrific-soundingÂ <a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/3085/has-anyone-used-hot-saucing-is-it-bad-parenting">âhot saucingâ</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Join us next week at the usual time when we&#39;ll be joined by <a href="http://paulbiggar.com/">Paul Biggar</a> and his wonderful Irish accent.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>John didn&#39;t know who Jeff was until the Stack Overflow Podcast started. (Pop quiz: What was the podcast called before Stack Overflow was Stack Overflow?) Jeff and Joel brought everyone with them on their initial journey of setting up the site. Transparency is king.</p></li>
<li><p>Version numbers don&#39;t matter to Stack Overflow. There&#39;s &quot;current&quot; and &quot;not current&quot; - it&#39;s a constant work in progress. Especially if version numbers are a ploy to get everyone to buy the software again.</p></li>
<li><p>We are downgrading Joel to an Etch-a-Sketch, since he can&#39;t get his trackpad to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Good programmers have a temptation to clean up Stack Overflow, and that can lead to everything suddenly looking off-topic. One result is that we get a lot of questions closed as General Reference. The gang discusses the many ways these questions have been handled over the years. There&#39;s even aÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/02/are-some-questions-too-simple/">blog post</a>Â on the topic.

<li><p>So what can be done to encourage good questions? One point of view is that a clearly no-work, no-effort question should not be rewarded with a brilliant answer. Another is that we shouldn&#39;t care about the questioner - the goal is to create a useful piece of information that makes the internet better. We&#39;re here to serve the 15 million people who get answers from the site without ever typing a word.</p></li>
<li><p>Weakness to be addressed: better canonical answers, better de-duping, better practices at editing questions. The answer might be... better social networking, although that&#39;s been heavily discouraged in the past. It&#39;s promotion on Other Channels that gets eyeballs onto pages. Therefore, promoting things you&#39;ve written is an incentive for asking better questions and giving better answers.</p></li>
<li><p>We allow (and sometimes encourage) users to ask and then answer their own questions. Ask a good question when you start the project, then keep trying to figure it out yourself.

<li><p>What if the system tried to parse the code you&#39;re typing a little bit? That way questions that aren&#39;t necessarily similar in their vocabulary would be more intelligently flagged as similar to other questions that are actually related.</p></li>

Version numbers don't matter to Stack Overflow. There's "current" and "not current" - it's a constant work in progress. Especially if version numbers are a ploy to get everyone to buy the software again.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone&#39;s back in their home towns this week (Sorry for the audio quality last week. It was Joel&#39;s fault [actually, it was TechCrunch&#39;s fault]). And joining Jeff &amp; Joel this week is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/johnsheehan">John Sheehan</a>, Developer Evangelist for <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff and Joel are bored of board meetings. How do you make them productive or even useful?Â <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/08/the-best-board-meetings.html">Brad Feld says</a>Â you should give out a document beforehand. Joel does this, and nobody reads it, but they at least pretend they did. Maybe Joel should plant money under the attendees&#39; chairs?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel launchedÂ <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a>Â at TechCrunch Disrupt last week, and they did not have adequate monitors onstage! It was representative of the general A/V &quot;screw-uppedness&quot; of the whole conference. Cool story, bro.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s talk about John Sheehan! He&#39;s a developer evangelist atÂ <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>Â and doesn&#39;t have enough Stack Overflow reputation. He travels around trying to make developers be more awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>The future of phones is in things like BBM, iMessage, etc - alternatives to SMS. Voice is a whole &#39;nother medium, for when emoticons just aren&#39;t cutting it anymore. Text is useful for transmitting pieces of information, but for more nuanced conversations voice or video is necessary. How fortunate for this conversation that we have someone from Twilio on the line!</p></li>
<li><p>New in the SE Universe:Â <a href="http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/">Linguistics</a>! Joel&#39;s dad thinks it&#39;s full of amateurs. We also have a site onÂ <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/">Christanity</a>Â now. It is less technical than Judaism... which isn&#39;t good. Our engine works better on more technical applications. Jeff: &quot;I&#39;m not 100% sure Christianity is working.&quot; It&#39;s still early, and it is getting more fact-based as it gets older, though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/">Bitcoin</a>Â is low on activity until it gets a new question. It&#39;s not what we call a healthy or growing site, but maybe that&#39;s okay for a site like Bitcoin. There is no defined formula, and it is still being figured out.</p></li>
<li><p>Now private beta participants will be able to invite others to the site while it&#39;s still private. This devalues committing to a proposal slightly, but the private betas sometimes need a little help.</p></li>
<li><p>John was at theÂ <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">BUILD</a>Â conference in Anaheim last week. It was like Disney World, but with middle-aged dudes with questionable hygiene! Windows 8 had a developer preview, but it&#39;s probably a year away from launch. John got to play with one of their tablets and says they&#39;ve taken touch and made it completely un-intuitive. The longer he used it, the less he liked it. John isÂ <a href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/09/twilio-and-windows-8-your-ticket-to-a-samsung-tablet.html">giving it away</a>Â to the developer of the coolest Twilio app that uses some of the new WinRT or Metro stuff announced.</p></li>
<li><p>Scrolling is a thing that many people have many feelings about. We got onto the subject through talking about Windows 8 merging its mobile and desktop systems, and how Apple is doing the same thing with iOS and OS X.</p></li>
<li><p>John asks: Does anyone have any faith in a PC manufacturer making a tablet you would actually want to buy? Joel says no. Alex says no. Everyone keeps doing things like putting stickers about the component brands on a sports car.</p></li>

<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/2588/draft-specification-for-api-v2-0">Stack Exchange API 2.0 is baking</a>! Take a look at the spec, and provide some feedback if you like.

Jeff uses the API as much as anyone that doesn&#39;t work here, rather than using things a special, sneaky way.

<p>Join us next week at the normal time when our guest will be John Siracusa from Ars Technica (or as Joel likes to refer to him: &quot;he wrote that really amazing review of Lion&quot;).</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Everyone's back in their home towns this week (Sorry for the audio quality last week. It was Joel's fault [actually, it was TechCrunch's fault]). And joining Jeff & Joel this week is John Sheehan, Developer Evangelist for Twilio.


Jeff and Joel are bored of board meetings. How do you make them productive or even useful?Â Brad Feld saysÂ you should give out a document beforehand. Joel does this, and nobody reads it, but they at least pretend they did. Maybe Joel should plant money under the attendees' chairs?
Joel launchedÂ TrelloÂ at TechCrunch Disrupt last week, and they did not have adequate monitors onstage! It was representative of the general A/V "screw-uppedness" of the whole conference. Cool story, bro.
Let's talk about John Sheehan! He's a developer evangelist atÂ TwilioÂ and doesn't have enough Stack Overflow reputation. He travels around trying to make developers be more awesome.
The future of phones is in things like BBM, iMessage, etc - alternatives to SMS. Voice is a whole 'nother medium, for when emoticons just aren't cutting it anymore. Text is useful for transmitting pieces of information, but for more nuanced conversations voice or video is necessary. How fortunate for this conversation that we have someone from Twilio on the line!
New in the SE Universe:Â Linguistics! Joel's dad thinks it's full of amateurs. We also have a site onÂ ChristanityÂ now. It is less technical than Judaism... which isn't good. Our engine works better on more technical applications. Jeff: "I'm not 100% sure Christianity is working." It's still early, and it is getting more fact-based as it gets older, though.
BitcoinÂ is low on activity until it gets a new question. It's not what we call a healthy or growing site, but maybe that's okay for a site like Bitcoin. There is no defined formula, and it is still being figured out.
Now private beta participants will be able to invite others to the site while it's still private. This devalues committing to a proposal slightly, but the private betas sometimes need a little help.
John was at theÂ BUILDÂ conference in Anaheim last week. It was like Disney World, but with middle-aged dudes with questionable hygiene! Windows 8 had a developer preview, but it's probably a year away from launch. John got to play with one of their tablets and says they've taken touch and made it completely un-intuitive. The longer he used it, the less he liked it. John isÂ giving it awayÂ to the developer of the coolest Twilio app that uses some of the new WinRT or Metro stuff announced.
Scrolling is a thing that many people have many feelings about. We got onto the subject through talking about Windows 8 merging its mobile and desktop systems, and how Apple is doing the same thing with iOS and OS X.
John asks: Does anyone have any faith in a PC manufacturer making a tablet you would actually want to buy? Joel says no. Alex says no. Everyone keeps doing things like putting stickers about the component brands on a sports car.
Totally hot right now:Â TrelloÂ t-shirts.
DevDays failed because we did not promise a thousand dollar piece of hardware to every attendee, like developers at BUILD got.
Jeff has not been to Burning Man. He likes the idea, but does not like the idea of being in the desert for so long. Joel did that in the army (cross that off your Podcast Bingo cards!), and it isn't pretty.
TheÂ Stack Exchange API 2.0 is baking! Take a look at the spec, and provide some feedback if you like. It'll be released by the end of the year. Stats on the API will maybe be released in a blog post or something. Jeff uses the API as much as anyone that doesn't work here, rather than using things a special, sneaky way. (You can read about past mistakes with the APIÂ on Kevin Montrose's blog. Jeff, Joel, and John share their opinions on APIs and company/developer relations in general.
New changes to the site are in the works. For example, no more duplicate title, and no more "Here code. You fix." questions will be allowed.

<ul>
<li><p>Joel gives rundown of what heâs seen at theÂ <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/SF2011/">TechCrunch Disrupt conference</a> in San Francisco so far. A discussion about differences between East Coast and West Coast tech startups leads Jeff and Joel to talk about how important centralized locations are for modern day companies.</p></li>
<li><p>The recentÂ <a href="https://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/08/facebook-stackoverflow/">Facebook deal</a>Â has led to a recent influx of general Facebook support emails. This leads to a discussion about user support and how other companies rate against Stack Exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>The merits of paying for internet services comes up, specifically the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">freemium</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>Â models. Jeff discusses the merits of 37signals and Joel recounts his time using that model.</p></li>
<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://meta.superuser.com/questions/3186/vote-for-the-most-valued-super-user">Most Valued Super User contest</a>Â is discussed, specifically how this contest gets people to do &quot;the right thing for the right reasons.&quot; Mention of the contest&#39;s prizes spur a discussion about merchandising (and inadvertently, whose head looks best on a plush Buddha).</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff announces that Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange are gettingÂ <a href="http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/">Nerd Merit Badges</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>TheÂ <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/">Bitcoin site</a>Â launched recently and is proving to be very popular. In other site news, Jeff mentions that enhancements are underway for the SE language sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff addresses the problem ofÂ <a href="http://meta.superuser.com/questions/3432/whats-the-super-user-community-policy-on-duplicates">duplicate questions</a>, specifically on Meta. A little later on, Jeff goes into detail about the defense mechanisms being put in place to block duplicate questions.</p></li>
<li><p>User interface proves to be a hot topic today between Jeff and Joel. What starts as a discussion about search engine functionality leads to a full-on talk about the ins and out and future of user interface. Listen to find out which user interface Jeff thinks is like a canker sore!</p></li>
<li><p>Many sites have launched in the last week, opened recently. The new targeted method of advertising proposals may be the cause of this. As new sites open, Jeff and Joel discuss the new sites with overlap of existing questions. This is currently an issue with the existingÂ <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/">Physics site</a>Â and the soon-to-launchÂ <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23848/theoretical-physics">Theoretical Physics site</a>.</p></li>

Jeff and Joel support their differing opinions on the necessity of localized Stacks (also known as the &quot;let your freak flag fly&quot; theory vs. the &quot;Hurricane Irene&quot; defense).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tune in next week at the normal time and with our normal in-studio setup (really, promise) for another episode as Jeff &amp; Joel are joined by John Sheehan, developer evangelist for Twilio.</p>

<p>See you then!</p>

<p>After a brief test of the emergency broadcast system, we plunge right into the podcast, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel is late because he had to go up to AOL HQ to pick up some more floppy disks for the office</p></li>
<li><p>We recently <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/">launched Blog Overflow </a>- which was actually a pretty substantial engineering and technical background to making it happen.</p></li>
<li><p>A huge discussion of the the SE infrastructure setup and why we host our own instead of relying on Amazon or another outside provider.Â  Hint: not only can we roll our own better, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/73969/what-would-stack-exchanges-yearly-expenses-be-if-it-were-to-be-using-a-third-par/73978#73978">but its a lot cheaper too</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the department of little tweaks with big effect, check out our &quot;network apocalypse&quot;: at one point, Stack reconfigured to separate different types of network traffic due to <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/per-second-measurements-dont-cut-it/">microbursting</a> overloading the network - this simple upgrade greatly increased the throughput and efficiency of the existing infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>In the good news department: Jeff talks about the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/expanding-user-cards/">expanding user cards</a> just introduced and based on a conversation from our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/se-podcast-15/">podcast a few weeks ago</a> with <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/1393/michael-at-herbivoracious">Michael Natkin</a></p></li>
<li><p>In the bad news department: we&#39;ve decided to cancel Stack Overflow DevDays due to low ticket sales - you can read <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/devdays-2011-is-cancelled/">Joel&#39;s full blog post</a> for all the details.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joining Jeff and Joel this week is <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/1393/michael-at-herbivoracious">Michael Natkin</a>, from our Cooking.SE site.Â  Michael is especially interesting because he is a computer programmer, but he doesn&#39;t answer questions at Stack Overflow, only on the Cooking site (he&#39;s our first guest to do so!) - he also writes over at <a href="http://herbivoracious.com/">Herbivoracious</a> (which he started back in 2007).</p>

<p>Their discussion includes:</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Joining Jeff and Joel this week is Michael Natkin, from our Cooking.SE site.Â  Michael is especially interesting because he is a computer programmer, but he doesn't answer questions at Stack Overflow, only on the Cooking site (he's our first guest to do so!) - he also writes over at Herbivoracious (which he started back in 2007).

Their discussion includes:


Michael is a vegetarian "foodie" (even though he really hates that word) - he and Joel commiserate over the oddities of being a vegetarian trying to eat out
Joel wants to know what type of questions usually come up on cooking (and how they maintain their 100% answer rate)
Joel thinks that you should never combine chocolate and garlic, but there's a Cooking.SE thread that disagrees
On the topic of what questions should be closed, Jeff points to this Electrical Engineering meta thread with a great example of why we need to keep closing questions
Kicking off a whole discussion of creating house rules - Joel and Michael jump into discussing Momofuku and restaurants who create dishes and refuse to alter them for guests
Jeff wants to take a deep dive into the top question of the month on Cooking.SE
Also interesting about Cooking.SE is that there are very few "modernist" questions on it
Make sure to check out Modernist Cuisine if you want to find a REALLY expensive cookbook (but its written by a patent troll, so we can't recommend it)
Michael is still seeing some good user growth with a few new faces coming in to the top users every quarter
One big question that comes up when you see a question that is salvageable but needs some work, is it better to just edit it for them or to point out the issue to them and ask them to change it
On a related note: should you point out if someone's question contains a bad assumption or is "doing it wrong" or just answer what they're looking for - check out this post on Waxy about his favorite sandwich shop and sweet tea
We've gone back and forth about how much promotion we should do on the individual site "brands" - ultimately we've found that we rather promote the individuals actually answering the questions and helping them build their reputations (and remember, once you make it to 2000 rep, we remove the "no-follow" from your profile URL so you get the Google juice)
We just improved the individual site Twitter accounts and they now tweet way more info.Â  New community blog posts also show up in the header of each site so users will find out about the new posts
We also rolled out massively improved tagging to help users better figure out what tags they should put on their questions
Should our new CHAOS folks post their team blog on Tumblr (to make sharing easy) or our own platform (because its ours)
If you haven't checked out our new newsletters - you can get a weekly list of the most interesting questions on any of the sites you're interested in, but don't necessarily visit every day.Â  As Joel says, its kind of like a free candy store!
Make sure to check out our upcoming conferences; Stack Overflow DevDays - a two day programming conference that will cover all the new technologies you need to know about; and Server Fault's Scalability Day - helping system administrators learn about massively scaling systems (with speakers from Facebook, Netflix, etc) - plus, save $100 off either conference with the discount code "podcast"


Thanks for joining us!Â  We'll be on "summer vacation" for the next couple weeks, but we'll be back on August 30th @ 4pm EDT with Anita Graser from GIS.SE (and our first female guest!).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tirania.org/blog/">Miguel De Icaza</a> joins Jeff &amp; Joel this week to discuss everything from Miguel&#39;s many projects to identity on the internet to playdates for toddlers.Â  Miguel is a force in the software world, having initiated and contributed to all kinds of products over the years - he&#39;s also well known for being one of the most productive programmers out there.Â  Check out the full episode for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Miguel has worked on a number of different projects including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">Midnight Commander</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">Gnome</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29">Mono</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian">Ximian</a> and more</p></li>
<li><p>Midnight Commander still continues to be developed to this day (albeit by other people) and it has some interesting new features that have been added</p></li>
<li><p>Joel reiterates his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">hate for huge numbers of configuration options</a> and appreciates Miguel not implementing ridiculous option trees in his programs</p></li>
<li><p>We have a brand new podcasting setup (again!) - keep your eyes open for an upcoming post detailing our whole setup</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff thinks that Unix couldn&#39;t make the same advances as some other systems (like Apple) because they didn&#39;t have a dictator to force massive changes on the community</p></li>
<li><p>After leaving Novell (which owns Mono), he <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html">launched a new company</a> (<a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>) that is working on some new projects, while also supporting the existing Mono community</p></li>
<li><p>Cross platform apps are stupid if they aren&#39;t coded using the native UX and tools (see Word 5 for Mac, Safari for Windows, etc) which makes them look different from every other program on that platform</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to check out <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area51</a> to see all of the new sites that are currently in commitment and under consideration of being launched.Â  Support the proposals that you want to see as Stack Exchange sites!</p></li>
<li><p>Our new <a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com">Bicycles</a> site just launched as a full site (and gotten its own theme)!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve started a new team of people (<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/100137/what-is-the-meaning-of-chaos-is-it-related-to-the-psi-character">CHAOS</a>) who will help enhance and promote many of our communities - the first project they are working on is enhancing question titles and converting many of them into actual questions</p></li>
<li><p>This has also led to a big debate internally over the relationship between great questions and titles and what guidelines we should set for making titles</p></li>
<li><p>Miguel is the most productive person that Joel knows (besides <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556/">James Franco</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>We have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/stack-exchange-site-newsletters/">a new newsletters feature</a> that allows you to get a weekly newsletter showing the top and most interesting questions from sites that you&#39;re interested in but don&#39;t visit every day.Â  Check outÂ <a href="http://stackexchange.com/newsletters">stackexchange.com/newsletters</a> - it&#39;s like a candy store filled with free candy!</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes people tell us they are interested in certain topics but their activity tells us something different (which is why we auto customize the homepage for each user) - its kinda similar to people on dating sites...</p></li>
<li><p>Every once in a while, we have a site that makes it through Area51 despite it &quot;sucking&quot; (eg: freelancers) - the problem with these sites is that there simply aren&#39;t enough questions because its too small a topic - the entire topic can be covered in one book</p></li>
<li><p>There are two current proposals that present an interesting contrast on this topic: <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/11655/christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1817/biblical-hermeneutics">Biblical Hermeneutics</a> - the biblical site has great, specific questions, where&#39;s Christianity doesn&#39;t and will likely be a weak site</p></li>
<li><p>Cross &quot;Joel tells an army story&quot; off your <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/stack-overflow-podcast-bingo/">Stack Exchange Podcast Bingo Card</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Coming soon: use as many OpenID logins as you want on SE (instead of the current limit of two)</p></li>
<li><p>One of our developers (Kevin Montrose) wrote a great blog post on how <a href="http://kevinmontrose.com/2011/07/31/your-email-is-practically-your-identity/">your email is your identity</a></p></li>
<li><p>Fair warning: Miguel lies a lot <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/migueldeicaza">on his twitter feed</a></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you get your tickets for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> (we just <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/documenting-devdays-2011-2-%E2%80%93-speakers/">announced the first round of speakers</a> for all the cities!) and use discount code &quot;podcast&quot; to save $100!</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff &amp; Joel are joined this week by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jzy">Jin Yang</a> - our resident web/graphic designer here at Stack (the distinction between the two becomes a discussion point). Â Once we get the proper picture of <a href="http://www.8164.org/">Jin</a> in the chatroom, he relates everything from his background in design to how he ended up at Stack Exchange and our philosophy behind design.</p>

<p>Full topics this week include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jin refers to himself as a &quot;web designer&quot; as opposed to a &quot;graphic designer&quot; because of the type of work he focuses on.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/se-podcast-12">Last week</a>, we discussed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6445794#6445794">this amazing answer</a> from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/88656/eric-lippert">Eric Lippert</a>Â and how it was a great answer in response to a poor question. Â Looking over this led Joel to notice that some people will vote to close a question as duplicate because the answers are the same even though the questions are different.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, there was already some questions on the topic but Eric decided to write the &quot;canonical&quot; answer that can be referenced from here out. Â Joel will often do the same thing on some of the other Stack Exchange sites (like in <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly/23326#23326">this OnStartups post</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes you do <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/">have to have SOMEÂ duplication</a>Â of questions to make sure that the different use-cases are covered, but you want to avoid there being 12 of the exact same question on every site.</p></li>
<li><p>When applying for Stack Exchange, Jin created a custom site targeted at Joel to show his abilities.</p></li>
<li><p>As Joel notes (and expands on) Jin went with the always smart tactic of spending a ton of time focusing on the one company he truly wanted to work for instead of very little time on 50 random companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Many people forget that truly great design is very hard, when you have to meld it with making sure the site stays useful and effective for the users.</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about continuous improvement: Jin notes anÂ <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/nummi">episode of This American Life</a> covering similar topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel likes Robin Williams&#39; (no, not that Robin Williams) book on design since it has really good and basic lessons on it - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321193857">The Non-Designers Design Book</a></p></li>
<li><p>We use a special CSS structure that lets us have a master CSS file for the entire network and then smaller CSS files for each site that just contain the differences between the generic template and the special parts of each site.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve also learned a number of design lessons: like that white on black designs just don&#39;t look very good and aren&#39;t usable.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been issues in the past with designers creating their designs on macs but those designs then looking funny on PCs because of differences in text rendering - fortunately, thanks to improvements on both ends, that happens less now.</p></li>
<li><p>While Jin is our in house designer and works on everything, we occasionally have help from some outside designers (such as for English and UX) who are members of the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Prompted by a question for the chatroom, Jin is really excited about getting to design <a href="http://rpg.stackexchange.com/">our RPG site</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Anonymous feedback is now live! Â That means non-logged in users and those with less than 15 rep can give feedback on how good questions/answers are. Â We haven&#39;t figured out how we&#39;ll incorporate this data yet, but we&#39;re collecting it and will figure that out.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you get your tickets for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> (we just <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/documenting-devdays-2011-2-%E2%80%93-speakers/">announced the first round of speakers</a> for all the cities!) and use discount code &quot;podcast&quot; to save $100!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll be back live next week with a bunch of brand new podcast gear Â and our special guest: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/16929/miguel-de-icaza">Miguel De Icaza</a>. Â Join us for the <a href="http://www.livestream.com/stackexchange">live stream</a> and in the <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/512">official show chatroom</a></p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Jeff & Joel are joined this week by Jin Yang - our resident web/graphic designer here at Stack (the distinction between the two becomes a discussion point). Â Once we get the proper picture of Jin in the chatroom, he relates everything from his background in design to how he ended up at Stack Exchange and our philosophy behind design.

Full topics this week include:


Jin refers to himself as a "web designer" as opposed to a "graphic designer" because of the type of work he focuses on.
Last week, we discussed this amazing answer from Eric LippertÂ and how it was a great answer in response to a poor question. Â Looking over this led Joel to notice that some people will vote to close a question as duplicate because the answers are the same even though the questions are different.
In this case, there was already some questions on the topic but Eric decided to write the "canonical" answer that can be referenced from here out. Â Joel will often do the same thing on some of the other Stack Exchange sites (like in this OnStartups post)
Sometimes you do have to have SOMEÂ duplicationÂ of questions to make sure that the different use-cases are covered, but you want to avoid there being 12 of the exact same question on every site.
When applying for Stack Exchange, Jin created a custom site targeted at Joel to show his abilities.
As Joel notes (and expands on) Jin went with the always smart tactic of spending a ton of time focusing on the one company he truly wanted to work for instead of very little time on 50 random companies.
Many people forget that truly great design is very hard, when you have to meld it with making sure the site stays useful and effective for the users.
Talking about continuous improvement: Jin notes anÂ episode of This American Life covering similar topics.
Joel likes Robin Williams' (no, not that Robin Williams) book on design since it has really good and basic lessons on it - The Non-Designers Design Book
We use a special CSS structure that lets us have a master CSS file for the entire network and then smaller CSS files for each site that just contain the differences between the generic template and the special parts of each site.
We've also learned a number of design lessons: like that white on black designs just don't look very good and aren't usable.
There have been issues in the past with designers creating their designs on macs but those designs then looking funny on PCs because of differences in text rendering - fortunately, thanks to improvements on both ends, that happens less now.
While Jin is our in house designer and works on everything, we occasionally have help from some outside designers (such as for English and UX) who are members of the community.
Prompted by a question for the chatroom, Jin is really excited about getting to design our RPG site.
Anonymous feedback is now live! Â That means non-logged in users and those with less than 15 rep can give feedback on how good questions/answers are. Â We haven't figured out how we'll incorporate this data yet, but we're collecting it and will figure that out.
Make sure you get your tickets for Stack Overflow DevDays (we just announced the first round of speakers for all the cities!) and use discount code "podcast" to save $100!


We'll be back live next week with a bunch of brand new podcast gear Â and our special guest: Miguel De Icaza. Â Join us for the live stream and in the official show chatroom

<ul>
<li><p>The big news for Stack Exchange this week: we officially <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/?p=8745">launched our new mobile support</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>We also recently <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/faster-edits-with-inline-editing/">introduced in-line editing</a> so you don&#39;t have to go to a separate page to edit an answer or question - we really want to encourage editing and have people help make questions better.</p></li>
<li><p>Patrick is the creator of BingoCardCreator.com - an amazingly popular site for putting together bingo cards for various occasions.Â  Apparently, one of the biggest markets is for <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com">Halloween Bingo Cards</a> with the entire month of October being worth $20k in sales.</p></li>
<li><p>He also has a new tool for helping doctor&#39;s offices <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/">remind patients of upcoming appointments</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Patrick owns a bunch of &quot;exact match&quot; domain names which provide a <a href="http://www.seoptimise.com/blog/2011/06/30-new-google-ranking-factors-you-may-over-or-underestimate.html"><em>huge</em> SEO bonus</a> since Google assumes that anyone who owns a domain exactly matching a search must be credible.Â  The bonus doesn&#39;t apply to hyphenated domains though.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel suspects (and Patrick confirms) that Google now incorporate WHOIS data into their ranking to discount any domains that are owned by people who have a history of owning crappy domains. (Joel has apparently also never seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810788/">Burn Notice</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>One potential issue with rewriting question titles to be SEO&#39;d is that not everyone searches in the same language that Google ranks for - so you might actually hurt how many people find your questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel misses all the &quot;labor of love&quot; sites that people have written because they truly love a subject - the quality and usefulness of those sites is FAR better than the useless drivel turned out by content farms.Â  Patrick does point out one defense of them though.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff has been wanting to talk more about the &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/iama">Ask Me Anything</a>&quot; concept that originated from Reddit.Â  Jeff thinks the format of Reddit isn&#39;t the best for the AMA idea (and in general has some issues with the format) and likes a new site: <a href="http://www.anyasq.com">AnyAsq.com</a> which is really optimized for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, this leads to a further discussion of the value of various formats for organizing different types of content.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel &amp; Jeff have often wondered how to prevent the &quot;tyranny of the sort order&quot; in which already upvoted posts (or posts from high rep users) get lots of upvotes on their answer even though there may be a better one.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Jeff and Joel are joined by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/183801/rory-blyth">Rory Blyth</a> (with no &#39;e&#39; as he is very insistent) fresh off his move to a new house in Portland, OR.Â  This week&#39;s topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rory has had a whirlwind of moving and relocating as of late.Â  Today is the first day he got more than 3 hours of sleep, but he is now happily in his new house. Rory hasn&#39;t been writing as much as of lately because of random personal and relationship issues - but he&#39;s free now! Ladies and gentlemen, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N91uZN4XKDo">start your engines!</a></p></li>
<li><p>Jeff recommends &quot;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/">Enemy of the State</a>&quot; (even though it stars <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/">Will Smith</a>) - it&#39;s a spiritual sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/">The Conversation</a> and it also contains a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">faraday cage</a>, in case you&#39;re interested in seeing one of those.</p></li>
<li><p>While working on <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.Net Rocks!</a> (our podcast competition - so don&#39;t visit that link) Rory moved for a while to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_London,_Connecticut">New London, CT</a> - and it only took one day to decide to move there.</p></li>
<li><p>Rory was also part of podcasting way back in the early days (of 2004) while everything was still being decided about formats, styles, enclosures, etc. He was also <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/10/podcast-71/">a featured guest on Podcast #71</a> of the Stack Overflow podcast in 2009!</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff wants to know what Rory has been up to for the past couple years: and apparently Rory is still very focused on iPhone development. One of the biggest changes: all the clever hacks that programmers did originally are now supported by real APIs which makes it less fun for the nerds.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://monotouch.net/">MonoTouch</a> was <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html">recently spun out</a> by Novell after its &quot;restructuring&quot; and is now tied in to <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>. Rory loves MonoTouch because of the ease of it and the incredible power that it gives developers, including cocoa bindings, the ability to drop in .NET binaries, efficiencies, etc</p></li>
<li><p>You can also find Rory&#39;s new site at <a href="http://www.rory.me">Rory.me</a> (once he actually starts blogging there)</p></li>
<li><p>One valid reason to use Objective C over MonoTouch is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1444777/how-big-is-an-objective-c-iphone-app-vs-a-monotouch-app">it is a much smaller file</a>,Â  Although it has gotten much more efficient recently, according to Rory.<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1444777/how-big-is-an-objective-c-iphone-app-vs-a-monotouch-app">
</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rory argues that fascism is good in tech products: from the iPhone to Xbox, by isolating and controlling everything in the platform it allows the company to control the experience and ensure quality.Â  Otherwise you can end up with things like Windows Mobile / Windows CE.</p></li>
<li><p>Google runs the risk of running into similar issues with Android.Â  The other question is if they are diversifying out too much (into crazy projects like wind power).</p></li>
<li><p>How do we keep Stack Exchange questions up to date? The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1444777/how-big-is-an-objective-c-iphone-app-vs-a-monotouch-app">Monotouch vs Objective C</a> question above is 2 years old now and may no longer be fully accurate; we accept edits from anonymous and 1 reputation users now, but how can we motivate them to improve this old question?</p></li>
<li><p>Rory is also one of the most &quot;prolific&quot; answerers on our site with the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/95/top-500-answerers-on-the-site">highest vote to answer ratio on the site</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Rory will also be speaking at <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> - so pick up your tickets now if you want to see him (with discount code &#39;podcast&#39; for $100 off)</p></li>

Rory hasn't been writing as much as of lately because of random personal and relationship issues - but he's free now! Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!
Jeff recommends "Enemy of the State" (even though it stars Will Smith) - it's a spiritual sequel to The Conversation and it also contains a faraday cage, in case you're interested in seeing one of those.
While working on .Net Rocks! (our podcast competition - so don't visit that link) Rory moved for a while to New London, CT - and it only took one day to decide to move there.
Rory was also part of podcasting way back in the early days (of 2004) while everything was still being decided about formats, styles, enclosures, etc. He was also a featured guest on Podcast #71 of the Stack Overflow podcast in 2009!
Jeff wants to know what Rory has been up to for the past couple years: and apparently Rory is still very focused on iPhone development. One of the biggest changes: all the clever hacks that programmers did originally are now supported by real APIs which makes it less fun for the nerds.
MonoTouch was recently spun out by Novell after its "restructuring" and is now tied in to Xamarin. Rory loves MonoTouch because of the ease of it and the incredible power that it gives developers, including cocoa bindings, the ability to drop in .NET binaries, efficiencies, etc
You can also find Rory's new site at Rory.me (once he actually starts blogging there)
One valid reason to use Objective C over MonoTouch is that it is a much smaller file,Â  Although it has gotten much more efficient recently, according to Rory.

Rory argues that fascism is good in tech products: from the iPhone to Xbox, by isolating and controlling everything in the platform it allows the company to control the experience and ensure quality.Â  Otherwise you can end up with things like Windows Mobile / Windows CE.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff &amp; Joel are joined by Steve Karantza, better know as <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/users/386/shirlock-homes">Shirlock Homes</a>, our #1 user on the <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/">DIY Stack Exchange</a>.Â  Steve is also our first non-programmer oriented guest on the podcast!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone wanted to know how Steve ended up on the site: turns out his son is a computer programmer who has used Stack Overflow for a while and encouraged his dad to check it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve is also a big user of <a href="http://community.thisoldhouse.com/">This Old House Pro</a>, a community for contractors hosted by This Old House.Â  The main difference is that he gets answers on This Old House but gives answers on DIY.SE.Â  Steve would also like to see some more contractors join DIY.SE</p></li>
<li><p>The number one problem he sees is people getting in over their heads.Â  Especially in regards to electrical and plumbing projects, people don&#39;t know or understand the codes and safety issues.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know if a contractor is going to be competent and good?Â  Best advice is to get referrals.Â  And once you have them, make sure they are real, go out and actually see how the jobs came out.</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#39;t seen <a href="http://thereifixedit.failblog.org/">There, I Fixed It</a>, go check it out for great examples of what not to do.Â  Especially, never, <a href="http://thereifixedit.failblog.org/2011/06/24/white-trash-repairs-thanks-flatty/">ever use a screwdriver as a fuse</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One great question that Steve answered was how to estimate the height of a tree: he <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/7100/is-there-an-easy-way-to-measure-the-height-of-a-tree/7110#7110">recommended an old logger method</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If at any point during a project you stop and think; how the heck do I do this?Â  It&#39;s time to stop and get advice, either from a contractor or other reliable source.Â  Steve relays the story of a friend who had a fixer-upper and continually called him for advice after getting stuck on a problem for 5 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Ever needed to do plumbing work but don&#39;t know how to sweat pipes?Â  Check out <a href="http://www.sharkbite.com/">Shark Bites</a> which form secure couplings without sweating.Â  Unfortunately - they aren&#39;t cheap.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to learn how to do home improvement work: just pick a project and start it.Â  Some contractors will also let you help out on projects on your house instead of one of their lowest level guys (but not all contractors will let you).</p></li>
<li><p>Steve tried to build his first house at the early age of 22 right after he left the air force - as with all early projects, there were a LOT of lessons learned.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff also related how learning building is similar to learning code: ultimately one of the best methods is to simply sit down (or stand up) with someone better than you and work on a project with them</p></li>
<li><p>One challenge for Steve has been learning all of the intricacies of the software and systems that make up the sites (like the difference between the <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/">main </a>and <a href="http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/">meta</a> sites), since he&#39;s not a computer guy.Â  He&#39;d also like to see some more highly experienced people come into the site.</p></li>
<li><p>The writing that Steve has done on the site has also spurred his desire to keep writing and based on it, he&#39;s even talked to some of the local papers about doing an &quot;Ask the Contractor&quot; column.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve also noticed how long people continue to read and vote on his answers over time.Â  Joel pointed out <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1054/what-are-my-options-to-replace-a-sliding-glass-door-screen">this question on sliding glass doors </a>that still continues to get lots of views even though only 3 people originally answered the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve is excited about the <a href="http://gardening.stackexchange.com/">Gardening and Landscaping</a> site (which is currently in public beta) - if you haven&#39;t checked it out, you should!</p></li>
<li><p>Steve&#39;s son Alex is also launching a new website - Axiom Home Services - to help homeowners with their home inspection questions and needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming up soon, we&#39;ll have a weekly newsletter which will recap interesting and popular questions from the week.</p></li>
<li><p>We just officially <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/devdays-is-back/">announced the launch of DevDays 2011 tickets</a> (yeah, yeah we&#39;ve talked about it before, but now its official).Â  As always, you can <a href="http://stackoverflow.eventbrite.com/">get your tickets</a> with a $100 discount by using the code &quot;blog&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Join us next Tuesday for a special surprise guest!Â  Not to mention, audio mixing provided by our very own <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/6212/jason-punyon">Jason Punyon</a>.</p>

Everyone wanted to know how Steve ended up on the site: turns out his son is a computer programmer who has used Stack Overflow for a while and encouraged his dad to check it out.
Steve is also a big user of This Old House Pro, a community for contractors hosted by This Old House.Â  The main difference is that he gets answers on This Old House but gives answers on DIY.SE.Â  Steve would also like to see some more contractors join DIY.SE
The number one problem he sees is people getting in over their heads.Â  Especially in regards to electrical and plumbing projects, people don't know or understand the codes and safety issues.
How do you know if a contractor is going to be competent and good?Â  Best advice is to get referrals.Â  And once you have them, make sure they are real, go out and actually see how the jobs came out.
If you haven't seen There, I Fixed It, go check it out for great examples of what not to do.Â  Especially, never, ever use a screwdriver as a fuse.
One great question that Steve answered was how to estimate the height of a tree: he recommended an old logger method.
If at any point during a project you stop and think; how the heck do I do this?Â  It's time to stop and get advice, either from a contractor or other reliable source.Â  Steve relays the story of a friend who had a fixer-upper and continually called him for advice after getting stuck on a problem for 5 hours.
Ever needed to do plumbing work but don't know how to sweat pipes?Â  Check out Shark Bites which form secure couplings without sweating.Â  Unfortunately - they aren't cheap.
If you want to learn how to do home improvement work: just pick a project and start it.Â  Some contractors will also let you help out on projects on your house instead of one of their lowest level guys (but not all contractors will let you).
Steve tried to build his first house at the early age of 22 right after he left the air force - as with all early projects, there were a LOT of lessons learned.
Jeff also related how learning building is similar to learning code: ultimately one of the best methods is to simply sit down (or stand up) with someone better than you and work on a project with them
One challenge for Steve has been learning all of the intricacies of the software and systems that make up the sites (like the difference between the main and meta sites), since he's not a computer guy.Â  He'd also like to see some more highly experienced people come into the site.
The writing that Steve has done on the site has also spurred his desire to keep writing and based on it, he's even talked to some of the local papers about doing an "Ask the Contractor" column.
Steve also noticed how long people continue to read and vote on his answers over time.Â  Joel pointed out this question on sliding glass doors that still continues to get lots of views even though only 3 people originally answered the question.
Steve is excited about the Gardening and Landscaping site (which is currently in public beta) - if you haven't checked it out, you should!
Steve's son Alex is also launching a new website - Axiom Home Services - to help homeowners with their home inspection questions and needs.
Coming up soon, we'll have a weekly newsletter which will recap interesting and popular questions from the week.
We just officially announced the launch of DevDays 2011 tickets (yeah, yeah we've talked about it before, but now its official).Â  As always, you can get your tickets with a $100 discount by using the code "blog"


Join us next Tuesday for a special surprise guest!Â  Not to mention, audio mixing provided by our very own Jason Punyon.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Jeff and Joel are joined by Greg Wilson, an author, developer, and former university professor, who is also an expert on open source software development.Â  Once make it through the jokes and get his mic sounding great, we can jump in and explore all kinds of interesting topics, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone&#39;s favorite Canadian airline? <a href="http://www.flyporter.com">Porter Airlines</a>!Â  What makes them so great?Â  They use FogBugz as their customer service software.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve hired a math intern to help us mine through all of our Stack Exchange data and (hopefully) improve the site. Â  And to make it better, he&#39;s an MIT student and Math.SE moderator.</p></li>
<li><p>According to a study of Microsoft data, what was the strongest <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=118790">predictor of bug rates</a> in Windows Vista?Â  The answer: how far apart the developers are in the org charts. The more separate they are, the more likely there are to be conflicting orders or different mind sets.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been fairly strong <em>opinions</em> for years on what makes a good programming setup/environment, but people are just now beginning to look at actual data to derive conclusions
Greg thinks this is LONG overdue, especially given that software development is an engineering backed profession - why weren&#39;t our processes based on science?
Even big companies, who have access to the data, have been avoiding actually using data for their decision making: people treat it as a craft rather than an engineering discipline</p></li>
<li><p>Greg has written several books on how to develop software better - two of which came out this year and are must reads.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308690300&amp;sr=8-1">Making Software</a>: Joel requires that you read this book,  because its the first one to take a scientific approach to making  software as opposed to the subjective and anecdotal way that most have  in the past (eg: everyone who has done one software project and then written a post on HN about how their method is &quot;amazing&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>Greg wanted to use the results of his studies to bring actual concrete steps back to professionals on how they could improve their process</p></li>
<li><p>His favorite chapter: while <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/678/test-driven-development-convince-me">Test Driven Development</a> is very popular right now, a survey of all of the studies that have been done on TDD have shown that the better the study done, the weaker the signal as to its benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Another study recently looked at how much effort goes into maintaining the build system: 5 to 30% of all development effort is spent on maintaining the build system.Â  With the variations being huge even when working on similar projects.Â  Clearly, there&#39;s a huge difference in the efficiency of some developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring programmer &quot;productivity&quot;: As Joel points out, any metric that  you come up with as a method for measuring programmer productivity can  be gamed some how.Â  He even made money as a consultant in the past  showing companies why they shouldn&#39;t hire consulting companies to  improve &quot;productivity&quot; since programmers would instantly game any system (which is how consulting companies appeared to be successful).Â  Ultimately, <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/26596/metric-by-which-to-hold-developers-accountable">it&#39;s pretty hard to actually measure</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Greg points out that the irony is that the single most correlated measure of productivity is simply lines of code written.Â  Joel counters with that only holds true, so long as the developers don&#39;t know they are being measured based on that (since its so easy to game).</p></li>
<li><p>His second book is <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a>: its entirely CC licensed so you can read it online for free.Â  if you do buy a hard copy though, all the proceeds go to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Greg decided to publish it for free online after seeing how quickly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047">Beautiful Code</a> was put onto torrent sites.</p></li>
<li><p>His key thesis behind it is that we don&#39;t teach people how to read code (only how to write it).Â  His example: you wouldn&#39;t hire an architect who had never looked at other designs before.</p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s really important isn&#39;t the internals of the code, but rather the architecture - especially when it comes to understand what you&#39;re trying to achieve.</p></li>
<li><p>The best parts about the book are where the authors stop talking about what&#39;s inside the code and start talking about why those things are there.</p></li>
<li><p>Deloitte performed a study called &quot;<a href="http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/Insights/Browse-by-Content-Type/research/persistence-project/b589835011011210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm">A Random Search for Excellence</a>&quot; (based on a book by Tom Peters called &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Excellence-Lessons-Americas-Companies/dp/0446385077">In Search of Excellence</a>&quot;).Â  They tried to explain the data that Peters used by assuming that all of the companies were on a random walk and found that yes, he didn&#39;t actually prove anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel is reading Henry Petroski&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Engineer-Science-Problems-Vintage/dp/0307473503/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2">new book</a> on the difference between science and engineering.</p></li>
<li><p>TO-DO: Greg needs more data for his upcoming work.Â  So take your favorite piece of open source software (something you find interesting) and take it apart and tell us how it all fits together.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s post on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html">building communities with software</a></p></li>
<li><p>Jeff&#39;s take: If you want to get better, work with programmers who are better than you.Â  Period.Â  And since its so important to pick your work family well, <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">consider coming to work at Stack Exchange</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to register for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> 2011!Â  Use the code &quot;PODCAST&quot; for a $100 discount in any city.</p>

<ul>
<li>We&#39;ll also be having a one day hackathon on December 13th in Washington DC - come join the entire Stack Exchange dev team in hacking away on your favorite open source project!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve launched a few new sites including <a href="http://astronomy.stackexchange.com/">Astronomy</a> and <a href="http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/">Philosophy</a>!Â  Plus, Travel is now in private beta and Personal Productivity is starting soon!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re going to start a weekly newsletter highlighting the best questions on the sites.Â  We&#39;re targeting this based on some recent data we&#39;ve found that a lot of our users don&#39;t return frequently after their initial visits and activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of how much we love our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/new-global-inbox/">universal inbox</a>,Â  we&#39;re working on an feature that would email the things that you missed from your inbox.</p></li>

Greg has written several books on how to develop software better - two of which came out this year and are must reads.
Making Software: Joel requires that you read this book,  because its the first one to take a scientific approach to making  software as opposed to the subjective and anecdotal way that most have  in the past (eg: everyone who has done one software project and then written a post on HN about how their method is "amazing").

<ul>
<li><p>Whatâs the proper numbering format for podcast episodes: decimal, binary, octal?Â  Thereâs also an extensive debate regarding whether Marco has ever been on the podcast: everyone but Joel agrees that he hasnât.</p></li>
<li><p>Marco talks about leaving Tumblr to start his own company (Instapaper)</p></li>
<li><p>Part of what made the move easier was that he did it on the side for about a year before leaving Tumblr (with the okay of his current boss of course).</p></li>
<li><p>By the time he left, Instapaper had become a full time job and Tumblr had become far more than a full-time job â it needed even more time and support.Â  It became very stressful knowing that even the slightest mistakes in code could cause 1100 people per second to get error messages</p></li>
<li><p>Instapaper is also a bit easier to support because itâs inherently designed for offline use, so if the servers go down, people arenât immediately deprived of the entire functionality like they are if your web service is down.</p></li>
<li><p>Instapaper was created by Marco to solve the problem of reading on the train and reading old articles that he had found while at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Marco is currently being confronted by the âbig playerâ problem (aka The Starbucks Problem), now that Apple has introduced their âReading Listâ feature in the newest version of iOS and Mac OSX.</p></li>
<li><p>As Marco points out though, thereâs several big reasons that he isnât really hurt by it: 1) It doesnât solve the offline problem â itâs only online bookmarksÂ  and (2) It doesnât clean the text to make it easier to read</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, it doesnât solve everyoneâs needs and at the same time, it educates the market as to the value of this type of service, thereby enlarging the entire market and creating more customers for Instapaper.</p></li>
<li><p>This tends to work really well for the small player when youâre trying to solve a big problem with lots of personal preferences â it doesnât work well when its one simple task that needs to be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of situations that are good for the little guy: RSS Readers, email clients, coffee shops, etc.Â  Examples of situations that are bad for the little guy: .ZIP files, regular bookmarks, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Thereâs also tons of successful notes and stock apps, despite Apple providing support for it natively.Â  So many people want more functionality that it creates a whole new market.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, if someone wants a bit more than what Apple provides by default, they are probably going to go to Instapaper and ultimately increase Marcoâs user base..Â  The key to this model: you have to do it better than the big guy</p></li>
<li><p>People sometimes also choose random or arbitrary reasons for choosing products (like the color or logo or name)</p></li>

<li><p>To combat this, he is considering a feature where he would email them saying âI noticed that you have X articles more than Y months old, do you want to archive themâ, thereby giving them an âoutâ.</p></li>
<li><p>People donât find to tend the app while searching for offline reading â they just find that as an additional benefit after they start using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel thinks that Facebook created the âLikeâ button in order to collect data about web pages that would be very good for creating a search engine</p></li>
<li><p>Marco also points out that Facebook provides all of these various embed platforms so that they get the cookie on your computer and then can see anytime you visit any of these pages and build a graph of what you (and everyone else) looks at.</p></li>
<li><p>Bringing it back to Stack Exchange: Jeff points out that weâve been considering giving anonymous users the ability to vote somehow (currently voting is the most protected form of interaction on the site).Â  One option is a âlikeâ or âthumbs-upâ button somewhere on the page.Â  Another option is to collect the votes from anonymous users, but count them in a separate tally or as a fractional vote</p></li>
<li><p>Fun Fact: there are two important etiquette rules in New York City</p>

Whatâs the proper numbering format for podcast episodes: decimal, binary, octal?Â  Thereâs also an extensive debate regarding whether Marco has ever been on the podcast: everyone but Joel agrees that he hasnât.
Marco talks about leaving Tumblr to start his own company (Instapaper)
Part of what made the move easier was that he did it on the side for about a year before leaving Tumblr (with the okay of his current boss of course).
By the time he left, Instapaper had become a full time job and Tumblr had become far more than a full-time job â it needed even more time and support.Â  It became very stressful knowing that even the slightest mistakes in code could cause 1100 people per second to get error messages
Instapaper is also a bit easier to support because itâs inherently designed for offline use, so if the servers go down, people arenât immediately deprived of the entire functionality like they are if your web service is down.
Instapaper was created by Marco to solve the problem of reading on the train and reading old articles that he had found while at work.
Marco is currently being confronted by the âbig playerâ problem (aka The Starbucks Problem), now that Apple has introduced their âReading Listâ feature in the newest version of iOS and Mac OSX.
As Marco points out though, thereâs several big reasons that he isnât really hurt by it: 1) It doesnât solve the offline problem â itâs only online bookmarksÂ  and (2) It doesnât clean the text to make it easier to read

<ul>
<li><p>Does &quot;Hell Banning&quot; -- making a problematic user&#39;s posts visible to just him or her -- make sense? You can see Jeff&#39;s post about it <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html">over on Coding Horror</a>.

<li><p>Sam Saffron has been <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00008/">working remotely for Stack Exchange</a> from Australia for about a year now. Sam came to our attention as an avid participant on Stack Overflow and meta, as well as his own homegrown Stack Overflow inspired support tool he wrote, <a href="http://community-tracker.com/">Community Tracker</a>. In addition to being the lead on the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/re-launching-stack-exchange-data-explorer/">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a>, Sam&#39;s touched almost every area of the engine at this point: improvements to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/improvements-to-badge-system/">badges</a>, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/membership-has-its-privileges/">privileges</a>, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/">edits</a>, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-users-page/">users page</a>, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/">tags page</a> â¦</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re starting to build a feature we call <strong>emacs.stackexchange.com</strong>, which essentially gives users a filtered view of Stack Overflow to specific topic groups, as represented by a set of tags. We have historically <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/factionalism-site-or-tag/">shut down Area 51 proposals that would factionalize Stack Overflow</a>, and although we feel this is the correct decision, we are sympathetic to the underlying concern. Stack Exchange sites are intended to be groups of topics, identified by tags, that are of broad interest to people who all love a topic -- like, say, <em>programming</em>. This is fine when you follow a large tag like [java] or [c#], but what about when you follow 20 small tags? Yes, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/improved-tag-sets/">you can set up a tag filter</a>, but it might be nice to have some default groupings for certain popular sub-areas -- thus, emacs.stackexchange.com instead of the Area 51 site proposal for emacs.</p></li>
<li><p>The bedrock guideline of <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq">our Area 51 site creation process</a> is, &quot;I&#39;d like to ask a question about {x} but there&#39;s no place on the Stack Exchange network to do so&quot;. We&#39;ve been a bit disappointed that the CSTheory community has been <a href="http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/947/is-theoretical-computer-science-too-narrow">unwilling to accept an expansion of their scope</a>, because there are technical computer science questions on Stack Overflow that <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/92563/ogod-why-are-we-helping-spread-misinformation">aren&#39;t being handled correctly</a> and have no other place to go.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://german.stackexchange.com/">German</a> and <a href="http://japanese.stackexchange.com/">Japanese</a> proposals are now public! These are our first <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/stack-overflow-around-the-world/">baby steps into other languages</a>, as guided by the community. It&#39;s already caused a bit of an issue as we &quot;advertise&quot; popular questions to the network that may have very few words in English. This also comes up with <a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/">http://judaism.stackexchange.com/</a> questions which can have quite a bit of Hebrew in them.</p></li>
<li><p>As Joel builds out <a href="http://stackexchange.theresumator.com/apply/5bbnOo/Community-Evangelism-Team.html">the CHAOS (NYC community development and evangelism) team</a> out, they start with a generalized online SAT/ACT style aptitude test.
Which Jeff did not pass. :) But the far more interesting test that we&#39;re giving candidates is what we call the &quot;Internet competency test&quot; -- how would you test someone to see if they are experts at using the internet? How to find things, how to send email, how to link, what &quot;The Facebooks&quot; and &quot;The Twitters&quot; are, and so forth? Building such a test is an interesting thought exercise. How would you do it?</p></li>
<li><p>A question from the chat room -- are there any metrics around how much <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/">the new suggested edits feature</a> has improved the site? One thing we&#39;ve learned is that &quot;simple&quot; edits to fix layout (code formatting) and proper English go a long, long way towards increasing the overall quality of the experience. At Zappos, <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/04/want-to-improve-sales-fix-grammar-and.html">they went so far as assigned Mechanical Turk tasks to edit and improve shoe reviews!</a> We have noticed that a) some users are hesitant to approve edits that totally rewrite the post, even when it&#39;s necessary and b) we don&#39;t get <em>nearly</em> as many anonymous edits as we expected; most edits come from existing or registered users.</p></li>
<li><p>The intent of editing questions and answers is to offer more permanent resources that can evolve over time. It is important to displace the old, out of date information that is often entombed in Google; for example with <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15945/keyboard-shortcut-to-access-the-first-link-in-a-google-search-page">Keyboard shortcut to access the first link in a Google search page?</a> Jeff was surprised to find that almost all the searches he did produced old, obsolete, and sort of incorrect results -- so he rolled up his sleeves and created a definitive answer, then edited the question and other answers. Hopefully future internet travellers will find this correct and up to date answerâ¦ and they can click edit to improve it, too!</p></li>
<li><p>We are open sourcing our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/">.NET web performance mini-profiler</a>. This has been <em>huge</em> for us on Stack Exchange, directly leading to <strong>2x-10x performance improvements across the board</strong>, and we are pulling it into all our sites. It&#39;s awesome and if you work at all in .NET building websites, I strongly encourage you to check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/">.NET web performance mini-profiler</a> for your projects. Kudos to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/">Jarrod Dixon</a> for putting this together in a highly polished, re-usable form, and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associates-00006-and-00007/">Marc Gravell</a> for coming up with the genesis of the concept in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-overflow-chat-now-live/">chat</a>.</p></li>

Does "Hell Banning" -- making a problematic user's posts visible to just him or her -- make sense? You can see Jeff's post about it over on Coding Horror. When issues like this are presented to the community, the gravity of the situation is often not fully conveyed to the audience. They can't see all the removed content that tells the story of how destructive that person was to the community. Of course, we always encourage discussion of general moderation issues on the per-site metas.
Two pieces of advice about moderation discussions: try to stick to generalized discussions about a broad class of moderation, without delving into minutiae specific to one user and one situation. To keep it useful to the community, avoid devolving into a  laundry list of every tiny thing that happened to every user.

Sam Saffron has been working remotely for Stack Exchange from Australia for about a year now. Sam came to our attention as an avid participant on Stack Overflow and meta, as well as his own homegrown Stack Overflow inspired support tool he wrote, Community Tracker. In addition to being the lead on the Stack Exchange Data Explorer, Sam's touched almost every area of the engine at this point: improvements to badges, privileges, edits, users page, tags page â¦
We're starting to build a feature we call emacs.stackexchange.com, which essentially gives users a filtered view of Stack Overflow to specific topic groups, as represented by a set of tags. We have historically shut down Area 51 proposals that would factionalize Stack Overflow, and although we feel this is the correct decision, we are sympathetic to the underlying concern.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s our first test of a live podcast!Â  In case you missed it, we streamed this week&#39;s podcast live during the taping. It&#39;s something we&#39;re playing with and may continue to do in the future if it is popular.Â  You can tune in to the live tapings Tuesdays @ 4 PM Eastern / 1 PM Pacific -- check Joel and Jeff&#39;s Twitter feeds for the location.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We&#39;ve found that hosting a podcast while running a business is more useful than you might think -- because it allows you to introspect on your own thoughts and decisions and have a history explaining why you made those bad decisions at the time.  Even if you only have 10 listeners, and one of them is your dad.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff is currently reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439100187/?tag=stackoverfl08-20">Super Cooperators</a></em> which focuses on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner&#x27;s_dilemma">prisoner&#39;s dilemma</a> and how it applies to social situations. In the real world, people remember your actions, and that history changes how they interact with you. Ultimately our concept of reputation derives from the realization that your current actions will have future consequences not just on other people, but on society and the greater internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the NY team went to hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Gordon">Bing Gordon</a> give a talk on gamification that covered a number of topics.Â  In particular, he noted that almost everyone (except for males age 18-24) prefer a cooperative game to a competitive one, and people are much more likely to continue with something if at least one other person sees and validates what they did. That&#39;s one reason why we&#39;re so gung-ho about everything being public -- by keeping everything visible and in the open, you encourage more civic-minded level of behavior than what happens behind closed doors. Sometimes people <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/42481/the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivation">can be turned off</a> by these types of reputation systems, though.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/05/wikipedia-and-the-death-of-the-expert">a fantastic article at TheAwl</a> about how Wikipedia made it possible for amateurs who are obsessive about a topic to become, en masse, as reliable as traditional experts.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Exchange is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/stack-exchange-is-an-openid-provider/">now an OpenID provider</a>!Â  We did this primarily for two reasons. First, any time you send people off to another site to sign up, you lose visitors.Â By keeping everything on Stack Exchange, we increase the success rate of sign ups. Second, while MyOpenID is a great service, it&#39;s free -- so there&#39;s no incentive for JanRain to maintain it and keep it in good repair. There have been some recent ... incidents ... with MyOpenID.</p></li>
<li><p>Down votes no longer cost you, the down-voter, any reputation points <em>on questions only</em>.Â  We found that too many people weren&#39;t willing to down vote questions because of the -1 cost to the voter. Downvotes on questions are a critically important signal for us in separating the good questions from the not-so-good questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Upcoming guests include Steve Karantza (<a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/users/386/shirlock-homes">Shirlock Homes</a> from DIY.SE), Rory Blyth, Dave Winer, Jason Calacanis, and more.Â  If you have guest suggestions, make sure to <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/91139/who-do-you-want-to-see-on-the-stack-exchange-podcast">add them to the Meta thread</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re hiring a Community Evangelism Team!Â  They&#39;ll be responsible for promoting our communities and sites out to new audiences, and helping them grow.Â It&#39;s a great job for anyone who wants to get into the startup world or a recent grad with a humanities degree who doesn&#39;t want to be stuck working at an agency for the next 10 years.Â  For more details, <a href="http://stackexchange.theresumator.com/apply/5bbnOo/Community-Evangelism-Team.html">check out the job post</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel takes his first question from the audience: why does he think great programmers aren&#39;t going to be found developing internal company apps?</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The podcast is on the road again this week, with Jeff and Joel coming to you live from Jeff&#39;s living room in El Cerrito, CA.Â  They&#39;re also joined by Josh Heyer (aka <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/811/shog9">Shog9</a>) who calls in from Colorado.Â  This is actually the second time we&#39;ve done a podcast from Jeff&#39;s house, the first time being <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/podcast-51/">Episode #51</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Server Fault and Super User have recently seen a substantial hit in the amount of traffic coming from Google the last few weeks.Â  There&#39;s a number of possible reasons, but Joel wonders if it has to do with <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/13920/google-ranking-and-bounce-rate">long clicks vs short clicks</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel&#39;s theory is that Google is looking at this ratio as a signal for the quality of a site: high quality sites should have more long clicks (meaning you don&#39;t return to Google quickly) and fewer short clicks (where you click a link and then immediately return to the search page).</li>
<li>We&#39;re also wondering if the Google algorithm change is penalizing sysadmin content - since a number of other sites focused on System Administrators / IT Professionals have also seen big drops in traffic from Google.</li>
<li>Jeff <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html">previously blogged about Google algorithm issues</a> and the fundamental risks of any site relying on a single source for so much of their traffic.</li>
<li>If you have any data or observations from running your sites, make sure to hop over to our <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/13920/google-ranking-and-bounce-rate">webmasters.stackexchange question</a> on this topic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Our guest today is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/welcome-valued-associate-josh-heyer/">Josh Heyer, our new part-time community manager</a>.Â  Josh was originally on Usenet, then moved to forums and Code Project, and joined Stack Overflow right after it launched; he&#39;s been with us from the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the first things that Josh pushed to change after joining the team was to make it more clear <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/23385/avoid-the-streisand-effect-be-clear-about-the-reason-when-suspending-an-account">why accounts were being suspended</a>.Â  Someone would get suspended and then complain about it publicly; they had a reason, but other people didn&#39;t.Â This sometimes led to lots of heat and noise on meta, detracting from the quality of the site.Â  By making the reason for a suspensions public, you remove the gossiping and public discussion.Â  And if you don&#39;t -- you get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">the Streisand effect</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re now tackling the last of the low hanging fruit in making the site performance better: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/the-speed-of-light-sucks/">serving static content using a CDN</a>.Â  By utilizing a CDN for lower priority/static content (like logos and other images) we can serve files faster to different areas of the world.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/sponsoring-lucene-net-logo-design-contest/">started a logo contest</a> for <a href="http://www.lucene.net">Lucene.net</a>, the open source project powering our search.Â  If you want to help out by trying your hand at designing a logo for this project, check out the <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-lucene-net-logo-77574">99designs contest</a> we created on their behalf.</p>

<li>Because our search currently focuses on relevance (determined by keyword mentions), we recommend editing good questions to make sure a proper set of keywords appear in them; this makes it easier for others to find these questions in search.</li>
<li>Remember that search results have several tabs, but always defaults to <em>relevance</em>. Try the votes, active, and other tabs to get a different sort of your search results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Currently, there&#39;s no way for anonymous users to indicate their satisfaction with a page -- should we add something to allow drive-by visitors to contribute? There&#39;s <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/">always anonymous editing</a>, of course, and this is the reason we keep view counters on pages - it&#39;s the only way for people who don&#39;t ask or answer, and don&#39;t have the 15 rep &quot;citizenship&quot; required to vote, to make an impact on the questions they visit.</p></li>
<li><p>How should we handle &quot;missing semi-colon&quot; questions -- where someone posts a chunk of code that isn&#39;t working and the only problem is that they had the name of a variable wrong, or forgot a semicolon somewhere? Since these questions will never be of benefit to anyone down the line, there&#39;s no real reason to keep them on the site.</p></li>
<li><p>This is also why we modified the language for the Too Localized close reason to read &quot;this question will not be helpful to future visitors&quot;.Â  It&#39;s a much clearer explanation of what that close reason is intended for, and we&#39;ve already seen an uptick in usage.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The podcast is on the road again this week, with Jeff and Joel coming to you live from Jeff's living room in El Cerrito, CA.Â  They're also joined by Josh Heyer (aka Shog9) who calls in from Colorado.Â  This is actually the second time we've done a podcast from Jeff's house, the first time being Episode #51.


Server Fault and Super User have recently seen a substantial hit in the amount of traffic coming from Google the last few weeks.Â  There's a number of possible reasons, but Joel wonders if it has to do with long clicks vs short clicks.


Joel's theory is that Google is looking at this ratio as a signal for the quality of a site: high quality sites should have more long clicks (meaning you don't return to Google quickly) and fewer short clicks (where you click a link and then immediately return to the search page).
We're also wondering if the Google algorithm change is penalizing sysadmin content - since a number of other sites focused on System Administrators / IT Professionals have also seen big drops in traffic from Google.
Jeff previously blogged about Google algorithm issues and the fundamental risks of any site relying on a single source for so much of their traffic.
If you have any data or observations from running your sites, make sure to hop over to our webmasters.stackexchange question on this topic.

Our guest today is Josh Heyer, our new part-time community manager.Â  Josh was originally on Usenet, then moved to forums and Code Project, and joined Stack Overflow right after it launched; he's been with us from the beginning.
One of the first things that Josh pushed to change after joining the team was to make it more clear why accounts were being suspended.Â  Someone would get suspended and then complain about it publicly; they had a reason, but other people didn't.Â This sometimes led to lots of heat and noise on meta, detracting from the quality of the site.Â  By making the reason for a suspensions public, you remove the gossiping and public discussion.Â  And if you don't -- you get the Streisand effect.
We're now tackling the last of the low hanging fruit in making the site performance better: serving static content using a CDN.Â  By utilizing a CDN for lower priority/static content (like logos and other images) we can serve files faster to different areas of the world.


Make sure to hop over to that blog post and help us (and you!) out by telling us which CDN works best for you.
We've been using our own home-brew CDN-like setup that offloads all of our static content off the main servers (to reduce CPU loads) and onto a side domain.Â  Unfortunately, these secondary servers were still located in our NY data center, so it did not do anything to reduce ping times to distant locations.
In our experience, breaking your static content off onto its own server can have a huge performance benefit, even for small or medium sites.

It's amazing how many highly technical people don't think to clear their browser cache when they're having a problem with a website loading.Â  Always clear your browser cache and try again before contacting a site's support team. Please?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the Stack Exchange podcast travels to England, where Jeff and Joel are joined by <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/what-happens-when-you-reach-200k-reputation/">Stack Overflow legend Jon Skeet</a> (and son!) along with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associates-00006-and-00007/">Marc Gravell</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Picking up the discussion from last week&#39;s episode: what constitutes a good question? <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/">Our very own &quot;How to Ask&quot; page</a> is a start -- and it&#39;s a <em>mandatory</em> page on Stack Overflow for all new askers. It&#39;s partially based on Jon&#39;s own post, <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">Writing the Perfect Question</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Why should you downvote a question? Is there such a thing as a bad question? There most certainly is! We generally tend to consider questions <strong>where the asker put virtually zero effort into asking</strong> worthy of a downvote. Jon has also written a bit about <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/05/20/reasons-for-voting-on-questions-and-answers.aspx">reasons for voting on questions and answers</a>. Two of the most important aspects of a <em>good</em> question, per Jon, are providing evidence that you&#39;ve researched the problem yourself, and providing as much information as possible: detailed code snippets, error messages, objectives, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Some users don&#39;t want to answer questions by users with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/new-question-asker-features/">low accept rates</a>.Â Jon deeply disapproves of the practice of leaving comments nagging users about their accept rate, especially since you can gain far more reputation by writing good answers that are highly upvoted rather than ones that are accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept rate by itself doesn&#39;t capture all of the information about how good (or bad) a member of the community a given user is. Perhaps accept rate could be expanded into a broader numeric metric of how &quot;civic minded&quot; a user is.</p></li>
<li><p>Only two things keep Jeff up at night: the size of the constantly growing database, and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56817/can-we-prevent-some-of-the-low-quality-questions-from-entering-our-system">maintaining quality within the community</a>. We absolutely want a friendly and civil atmosphere, but as the site grows, people have to learn to follow the norms and guidelines of the site themselves without manual hand holding. It doesn&#39;t scale.Â Ultimately, we can&#39;t save every user, and some have to be turned away from the site in order to protect the overall quality of the community. You must give a little to get.</p></li>
<li><p>To maintain quality, we started capping the number of questions that can be asked by a user in a given time period. If users are submitting more than 6 questions a day, or more than 50 questions a month ... are they <em>really</em> putting the appropriate amount of research effort into their questions?</p></li>
<li><p>Jon wonders if there are algorithmic solutions to detect users asking low quality questions - similar to how GMail reminds you when you reference an attached document in your email, but forget to actually attach something.Â  Jeff responds that we <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/72523/heuristics-for-detecting-a-bad-answer">already do that for answers</a>, and are beginning to aggressively extend it to questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Following up on the previous conversations about <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/">improved flagging tools</a> -- we get hundreds of flags per day, and the vast majority of them are valid. (Comment flags ... not so much). Even though we&#39;re buried in them at the moment, we welcome flags from the community because nearly every one goes directly towards a better signal-to-noise quality ratio on your site. So keep &#39;em coming!</p></li>
<li><p>Jon wonders whether the quality of answers is increasing or declining.Â  Jeff and Joel respond that not only are the percentage of answered questions increasing but that answer quality, to their knowledge, has never been disputed.Â It&#39;s fundamentally easier to preserve the answer experience than the question experience because users love to vote on answers: good answers go to the top, bad answers to the bottom.Â  But the flow of incoming <em>questions</em> -- which make up the entirety of the front page and the top 25% of every question page -- have a hugely disproportionate effect on any Q&amp;A system; that&#39;s why we spend so much time focusing on them.</p></li>
<li><p>The main issues we see with answers isn&#39;t quality per se, but that people misuse the answer field to enter thank yous, pleas for help, and other irrelevancies. We do provide the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-answer">How to Answer</a> page which is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/how-to-say-thanks-in-an-answer/">automatically shown</a> when we detect such answers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Stack Exchange workflow isn&#39;t necessarily the most natural for how most new people ask questions.Â  Most would start out with a small question and proceed to ask a series of followups while leading down a path and escalating the conversation after being assured the other person is engaged as opposed to having to put all of the information in the first post (almost more like an instant messaging conversation).Â Jeff points out that there are some sites that work like that, such as <a href="http://www.chacha.com/">ChaCha</a>, however it&#39;s a very different model. If you prefer this type of rapid back and forth interaction, don&#39;t forget that there&#39;s always <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com">chat.stackexchange.com</a> and <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com">chat.stackoverflow.com</a> -- our live chat rooms!</p></li>
<li><p>Is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/devdays-2011-planning-begins/">Stack Overflow Dev Days 2011</a> the best name for the conference or should we come up with something new?Â  Is the term &quot;Dev Days&quot; being used by too many conferences?</p></li>
<li><p>Over the holidays last year, Jon wrote an epic 45 (!) series of blog posts about <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2011/02/23/reimplementing-linq-to-objects-part-45-conclusion-and-list-of-posts.aspx">reimplementing LINQ to Objects</a>. It&#39;s a fantastic and utterly essential resource for anyone interested in the guts of LINQ.</p></li>
<li><p>Jon&#39;s old and trusty Samsung NC10 laptop was recently stolen - so he&#39;s now rocking a <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeos/">Chrome OS</a> laptop on his daily commute (which unfortunately means he only has a browser and no compiler on his daily commute).Â  It did however lead to him discovering <a href="http://compilr.com/">Compilr</a> which allows you to compile code on the web - he thinks it would be amazing to integrate that into Stack Overflow so you can check code from inside questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff reveals that of all the SE sites he <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/febfb878-3f6f-4215-9323-46d15d62ac7d?tab=accounts">participates on</a>, his most satisfying answer to date was <a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/1244/how-to-deal-with-tantrums-without-spanking/1245#1245">this post on parenting</a>.Â Knowing that his answer helped another person with <em>his own child</em> -- that&#39;s especially personal and gratifying.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Jon needs your help!Â  If he is chosen to speak at DevDays 2011, what do you  want to hear him speak about?Â  Enter your suggestions in the comments to this post. Sadly, Jon was having so much fun with the podcast that he forgot to put dinner in the oven halfway through the taping - hence we are left with this picture of the three sitting on their laptops, waiting for dinner to cook while accompanied by a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© dragon left over from a recent birthday party for Jon&#39;s children.</p>

<li><p>Scott wonders how so many people have so much time to sit around on Hacker News and Reddit (and everywhere else) discussing these blog posts when they have work to do. Of course we have to reference Clay Shirky&#39;s classic <a href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20080512021738/http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">Gin, Television, and Social Surplus</a> here.</p></li>

<li><p>Microsoft has an amazing video conferencing system known as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uc/products/roundtable.mspx">RoundTable</a> -- now branded as <a href="http://www.polycom.com/products/voice/conferencing_solutions/microsoft_optimized_conferencing/cx5000.html">the Polycom CX5000</a> -- that captures the room in 360 degrees and then automatically detects and shows the person who is talking.

<li><p>Over on <a href="http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/">mechanics.stackexchange.com</a>, Jeff wonders why online car communities are so brand-centric -- there are hundreds of dedicated sites for Ford enthusiasts, and Subaru enthusiasts, and so forth. Whereas programmers can have Java and Python installed side by side on the same PC, you have to own a lot of physical, real world vehicles to have experience with many different car brands -- or, be an auto mechanic. Perhaps programmers are kinda-sorta mechanics in the sense that they spend most of their time practicing <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/the-noble-art-of-maintenance-programming.html">the noble art of maintenance programming</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Exchange sites do well in professions where you can open a relevant Stack Exchange site in a window side-by-side with the work you&#39;re already doing on the computer. But what about people who <em>don&#39;t</em> regularly work on computers? Is it realistic to expect people who tend to work offline to take the time and effort to come online after they finish working and <em>keep</em> discussing their work?Â Or, will the proliferation of computing devices like smartphones and tablets bring the online world to them <em>while</em> they work? It does happen, since <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com">diy.stackexchange.com</a> is clearly an offline site but produces a lot of really high quality questions and answers about home improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;veÂ improved flagging dramatically on Stack Exchange over the last few months. You may have noticed a public flag weight value on some user profiles. Your flags now carry different weight depending on how accurate and helpful your flags have been in the past ... and the more you successfully flag, the more daily flags you&#39;ll get, in a sort of virtuous cycle.</p></li>

Welcome Scott Hanselman! Be sure to check out both of Scott's excellent podcasts at Hanselminutes and This Developer's Life.
Joel recently wrote an unintentionally controversial blog post about lunch and how important it is here at Stack Exchange and Fog Creek.Â Despite the claims that Joel is torturing introverts by forcing them to eat lunch together, the truth is that almost everyone at both companies is introverted and yet enjoy lunch together.
Scott wonders how so many people have so much time to sit around on Hacker News and Reddit (and everywhere else) discussing these blog posts when they have work to do. Of course we have to reference Clay Shirky's classic Gin, Television, and Social Surplus here.

Over on mechanics.stackexchange.com, Jeff wonders why online car communities are so brand-centric -- there are hundreds of dedicated sites for Ford enthusiasts, and Subaru enthusiasts, and so forth. Whereas programmers can have Java and Python installed side by side on the same PC, you have to own a lot of physical, real world vehicles to have experience with many different car brands -- or, be an auto mechanic. Perhaps programmers are kinda-sorta mechanics in the sense that they spend most of their time practicing the noble art of maintenance programming.
Stack Exchange sites do well in professions where you can open a relevant Stack Exchange site in a window side-by-side with the work you're already doing on the computer. But what about people who don't regularly work on computers? Is it realistic to expect people who tend to work offline to take the time and effort to come online after they finish working and keep discussing their work?Â Or, will the proliferation of computing devices like smartphones and tablets bring the online world to them while they work? It does happen, since diy.stackexchange.com is clearly an offline site but produces a lot of really high quality questions and answers about home improvement.
We'veÂ improved flagging dramatically on Stack Exchange over the last few months. You may have noticed a public flag weight value on some user profiles. Your flags now carry different weight depending on how accurate and helpful your flags have been in the past ... and the more you successfully flag, the more daily flags you'll get, in a sort of virtuous cycle.
Scott asks: why should I care about all these points and flags and badges and reputation systems on Stack Exchange? What's the point of you guys building your own Dungeons and Dragons MMORPG system online?


Tune in to next week's podcast when Joel will be "live" from London and our guest will be the infamous Jon Skeet!

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff and Joel discuss missing the openness that the old podcast provided.Â  Since the podcast is just a recording of their weekly call, it gives listeners an insight into the decision making and vision behind Stack Exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the Stack Exchange metas have been having vibrant debates and discussions about the role of the community and moderators in shaping debates - but what are the unseen upsides to having this vibrant meta community?</p></li>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of &quot;civilians&quot; (users whose first login was to a site other than StackOverflow, SuperUser or ServerFault) on Stack Exchange sites has grown to 36% since the launch of SE.</li>

<li><p>Launching this week is the beta of the brand new <a href="http://howthingswork.stackexchange.com">HowThingsWork</a> community.Â  Jeff and Joel discuss its odds for success, challenges it faces, and lessons learned from the launches of past communities.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/4818/what-questions-should-be-closed-with-reason-too-localized">numerous discussions</a>over the last few months about the closing of questions for being &quot;too localized&quot; - Joel and Jeff discuss their (strong) feelings on how and when this should be used and why you shouldn&#39;t ask about why there&#39;s a pothole outside your house but you should ask why cities have so much trouble maintaining their roads in general.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plus, did someone successfully troll Joel on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/86809/what-are-the-big-developer-conferences-in-australia">this thread</a>?</li>

<li><p>Coming up in September and October this year: it&#39;s Stack Overflow Dev Days 2011!Â  We&#39;ll be doing Dev Days in fewer spots this time (4 instead of 10) but they&#39;ll be bigger and better - plus running for two days instead of just one.Â  Dev Days will be taking place in 4 cities around the world, one each somewhere in the US West Coast, US East Coast, UK and Australia.Â  Stay tuned at the Stack Overflow blog for more details.</p>

<li>Help us out - make sure to <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/88052/what-topics-would-you-like-to-learn-at-devdays-2011">let us know what topics you want to see covered</a></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Jeff sit down with our new community coordinator, Robert Cartaino, to record a &quot;bonus&quot; podcast discussing the future of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange 2.0.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00005/">hired Robert Cartaino</a> as a full time community coordinator to act as both city planner, sociologist, and programmer with deep technical background. He will be pivotal in helping us move toward the brave new world of <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0">Stack Exchange 2.0</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than the old model of &quot;pay us to use our software&quot;, Stack Exchange is now free. We&#39;re setting up a<a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0"> democratic process where the community itself will determine how and when create new communities</a>. We liken it to Usenet 2.0.</p></li>
<li><p>The tension for us is that we want to offer a public service -- a community commons that is owned, governed, and mostly operated by the community in a very transparent way -- but like Craigslist, we are walking the line between <em>behaving</em> like a non-profit company while remaining a for-profit company.</p></li>
<li><p>As a thought experiment, we&#39;d love it if that three years from now a new community is created in a language <em>we don&#39;t even understand</em> which meets the same criteria we originally created Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User under. That is, it&#39;s a community you&#39;d be proud to be associated with, and it fills the internet with useful, practical information. Our goal is to leave the internet better than we originally found it.</p></li>
<li><p>The new site creation tool is currently under development and should appear in about a month for public participation. Right now there are <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/site-proposal">74 (!) site proposals on meta.stackexchange.com</a> for initial discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that removing money as a motivator actually frees people to participate simply because they love the topic, without being encumbered by the &quot;don&#39;t make me think&quot; factor of &quot;is it worth my time to even do this at all?&quot; We want to bring together the intersection of those people who love a topic, and want to make the internet a tiny bit better, one post at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>As for ownership, there is a concept of site founders for those who commit to a site and follow through on that commitment, and interim moderators during the private and public beta will be chosen from the most motivated users. And of course all content generated will continue to be Creative Commons licensed and freely available to anyone who wants it.</p></li>
<li><p>You are by no means alone -- we found that &quot;build it and they will come&quot; didn&#39;t work well for Stack Exchange. Under the new system, the community itself, us, will seed and support your site, and we will actively promote it as neighbor in our existing site network. We want to centralize and group community rather than fragment it, which is what the old SE model tended to do.</p></li>
<li><p>One of our Big Hairy Audacious Goals is to achieve some form of mainstream awareness. This is something that Facebook and Twitter have achieved, but we don&#39;t feel that Digg and Reddit have. It&#39;s our hope that if we keep taking baby steps outside our core engineering / programmer safety zone that we&#39;ll eventually get there.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a surprising amount of friction when trying to &quot;move&quot; an existing community to a new format. It&#39;s almost more practical to set up another community that runs in parallel and those who are attracted to the new format can move, while the old guard can stay with the comfort of what they know.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you enjoyed this &quot;bonus&quot; podcast. We&#39;re still not sure when or if the next podcast will occur; keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com">blog.stackoverflow.com</a> for the latest news.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Jeff sit down with <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/users/1/anton-geraschenko">Anton Geraschenko</a> to discuss the unique qualities of a community of expert mathematicians, how to capture a sphere in a knot, and the importance of off-site backups.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Stack Overflow team will be in NYC from April 2nd to the 9th for a planning session. Expect exciting announcements at the end of that period, including some that will <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/03/podcast-future/">affect the podcast</a>. Maybe there will be a <a href="http://s235.photobucket.com/albums/ee242/bshiloff/?action=view&amp;current=DingoandtheBaby.flv">Stack Overflow morning zoo crew</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>There will also be a Stack Overflow open house in NYC sometime that week, so if you&#39;re in the area, please keep an eye on the blog!</p></li>
<li><p>Anton founded <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">Math Overflow</a>, which runs on the Stack Overflow engine via <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>. Math Overflow might be the largest community of Math PhDs (and PhD candidates) on the internet. Anton, interestingly, is not a programmer so he was outside our initial audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Anton attributes much of the initial success of Math Overflow to math bloggers, and most notably <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/">Secret Blogging Seminar</a>. He also solicited emails from influential members of the math community and invited them to all participate at launch.</p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, Anton also cites the importance of a meta-discussion site to the overall success of a community. This is a conclusion we (well, I) had to be dragged to, kicking and screaming, before we finally created <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">meta.stackoverflow.com</a>. I suppose it is analogous to having a government of some kind before you can have a country.</p></li>
<li><p>The meaning of Joel&#39;s oft-repeated phrase &quot;no question is too easy&quot; -- which I would rephrase as &quot;no question should be uninteresting&quot; -- has a whole different dimension on a site like Math Overflow which is intended for graduate level mathematics questions. Per Anton, you should probably ask &quot;Does my community care about that?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>We wondered if any Math Overflow question, given the highly specialized audience, could be popular in the broader internet sense. Anton cites <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/8091/is-it-possible-to-capture-a-sphere-in-a-knot">Is it possible to capture a sphere in a knot?</a> as a possible example.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Joel and Jeff sit down with Anton Geraschenko to discuss the unique qualities of a community of expert mathematicians, how to capture a sphere in a knot, and the importance of off-site backups.


The Stack Overflow team will be in NYC from April 2nd to the 9th for a planning session. Expect exciting announcements at the end of that period, including some that will affect the podcast. Maybe there will be a Stack Overflow morning zoo crew!
There will also be a Stack Overflow open house in NYC sometime that week, so if you're in the area, please keep an eye on the blog!
Anton founded Math Overflow, which runs on the Stack Overflow engine via Stack Exchange. Math Overflow might be the largest community of Math PhDs (and PhD candidates) on the internet. Anton, interestingly, is not a programmer so he was outside our initial audience.
Anton attributes much of the initial success of Math Overflow to math bloggers, and most notably Secret Blogging Seminar. He also solicited emails from influential members of the math community and invited them to all participate at launch.
Interestingly, Anton also cites the importance of a meta-discussion site to the overall success of a community. This is a conclusion we (well, I) had to be dragged to, kicking and screaming, before we finally created meta.stackoverflow.com. I suppose it is analogous to having a government of some kind before you can have a country.
The meaning of Joel's oft-repeated phrase "no question is too easy" -- which I would rephrase as "no question should be uninteresting" -- has a whole different dimension on a site like Math Overflow which is intended for graduate level mathematics questions. Per Anton, you should probably ask "Does my community care about that?"
We wondered if any Math Overflow question, given the highly specialized audience, could be popular in the broader internet sense. Anton cites Is it possible to capture a sphere in a knot? as a possible example.
Math Overflow did some community specific customization by incorporating jsMath markup in their posts. This has always been the vision, to provide tools that tailor the 'wiki' aspect of the Stack Overflow to the needs of particular expert communities. They plan to switch to the newer MathJax soon. And LaTeX is of course a long term standard in this area.
I now appreciate the importance of off-site backups. It's unlikely your datacenter will be hit by a meteor, but the odds of something going wrong with the air conditioning is much more likely. How likely? It happened to us! Remember kids, eat your Wheaties, and do your off-site backups! We're also entertaining the idea of a read-only mode for the website for these rare conditions so we don't have to tackle the very difficult problem of synchronizing data when you are running on a live backup.
Since we haven't launched the Stack Exchange site on Siberian husky puppies (yet), Joel asks for some listener input on what type of treats his new dog Taco would like.
Remember, podcast will be on hiatus for a bit while we retool it -- your suggestions are welcome in the interim, see you in about a month!

<ul>
<li><p>We were surprised that so many people who read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/02/14.html">Joel&#39;s article about our venture capital experiment</a> were unable to imagine any way we could put millions of dollars to use.</p></li>
<li><p>If you consider that our core mission is to kill software like <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a> and <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a>, and you had millions of dollars, what would you do and how would you do it?</p></li>
<li><p>We were also a little disappointed that some people thought we would be willing to damage the community in some kind of quest to create a business. Hopefully we can be given a bit more credit than that -- Joel and I may be dumb, but we&#39;re not dumb enough to destroy the very thing we&#39;re trying to create!</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing a VC partner is like a marriage, and our philosophy is to only marry someone who has compatible views to our own.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if we didn&#39;t take VC, the process of talking to all these smart people who have accomplished so much in the industry was illuminating, and helped us synthesize and crystallize our own strategy for what we want to do with Stack Overflow -- we&#39;re excited about it, and we think you will be too once we can talk about it in more detail!</p></li>
<li><p>I was away for a two week trip with my family to beautiful New Zealand, where I gave a talk at Webstock 2010 titled <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/codinghorror/webstock-2010-stack-overflow-building-social-software-for-the-antisocial">Stack Overflow: Building Social Software for the Anti-Social</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m buying a new laptop from Dell, and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/40585/free-laptop-to-deserving-meta-user-complete">giving away my old Dell laptop</a> to a deserving meta.stackoverflow.com community member. Joel is a hard-core ThinkPad fan, but I believe what the world needs is more of an Ikea PC hardware experience. Dell&#39;s design isn&#39;t quite there yet but it has gotten better.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel elaborates a bit on <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100301/lets-take-this-offline.html">why he&#39;s planning to quit blogging</a>. There&#39;s plenty of precedent for leaving while you&#39;re still ahead, <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html">like Bill Watterson (of the comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;) did</a>. After 10 years of doing the same thing, you might want to evolve and do something different, too -- but hopefully not vanish without a trace. I&#39;m still trying to convince him not to quit podcasting.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s well known that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/the-elephant-in-the-room-google-monoculture.html">90% of our traffic comes from Google</a>. But did you know that Google is about the only company with a competent spider, based on our logs? There are so many terrible spiders, even from large companies that really should know better. It&#39;s a chicken and egg problem; Google&#39;s spidering is so far ahead of every other search engine that I&#39;m unclear how anyone could switch -- the result pages simply wouldn&#39;t be there!</p></li>
<li><p>I have found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard Aiken</a> quote <em>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about people stealing an idea. If it&#39;s original, you will have to ram it down their throats.&quot;</em> to be very true with regards to Q&amp;A and Stack Overflow. The corollary to this is that if you don&#39;t have to fight people to convince them your idea is good, your idea might not be so hot.</p></li>
<li><p>Even very smart people have to be in the right place at the right time to be successful. The best success strategy is probably dogged, bullheaded persistence, because there are so many variables you can&#39;t control or even predict.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener question:</p>

<p><strong>Michael from Cambridge</strong>: &quot;What if Google, or another large company, decided to clone your product and give it away for free? What should a hypothetical startup do if this happens to them?&quot;</p>

Meet the Stack Exchange team -- David Fullerton, Aaron Maenpaa, and Emmett Nicholas.
For Stack Exchange sites that have a smaller community, Stack Exchanges may email users more aggressively, to invite users to answer less trafficked SE questions. Joel proposes that weekly roll-up emails might work well on smaller Stack Exchange sites.
Stack Exchange is a hosted service; it's currently running on 2.5 servers and soon a third.
Stack Exchange has an export feature, so all the data in your site can be dumped out to a file, similar to the way the monthly Stack Overflow cc-wiki data dumps work.
Joel blogged about Stack Overflow looking for venture capital -- that should not affect Stack Exchange. In any case, even if it did, you can use your own domain name which you take with you, and as mentioned above, you can export all your data. There should be competition, and smart competitors will support the Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange export formats.
Stack Exchange pricing is already at maximum, primarily to reduce demand to a level that the current SE team can support. It can only go down over time! It is definitely our goal to make it easier over time for everyone who wants a Stack Exchange site to have one. We're exploring a lot of possibilities including ad subsidized; it's also possible that larger corporate adoption of Stack Exchange may subsidize the smaller community sites as well.
Right now every Stack Exchange site has its own IIS website (even though they all share the same app pool), but that turns out to be not a great performance model for lots of small sites.
One of the Catch-22s of a Stack Exchange site is that fundamental actions like voting up and creating tags require reputation, but nobody has any reputation on a new site. The Stack Exchange team added a "bootstrap mode" which relaxes a lot of these requirements so you can get your site up and running.

<ul>
<li><p>I will be at <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/10/speakers/">Webstock 2010</a> and in New Zealand for the next two weeks. I was excited to learn that the singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_(singer)">Wing</a> is from New Zealand. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoYrBdw-aDg">Hear Wing in action</a>. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. OK, maybe I didn&#39;t warn you.</p></li>
<li><p>I encouraged Joel to have the <a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange</a> team on for a podcast while I am gone for two weeks. There&#39;s a lot of interesting re-engineering of the Stack Overflow engine necessary to support lots of small and medium sites on our engine. If you have questions from the Stack Exchange team, please contribute them to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4264/stack-exchange-team-questions-for-podcast-84">this Meta Stack Exchange thread</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I am not a fan of email, to put it mildly, as I wrote in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001191.html">Is Email = Efail</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001302.html">Email: The Variable Reinforcement Machine</a>. Given my discomfort with email, I struggle with the role of email on Stack Overflow -- mostly trying to keep it at arms&#39; length while using it appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree with Joel&#39;s position here, which is that aggressive email notifications are <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.4511.8">toxic to the growth of a community</a>. That&#39;s why our email notifications are somewhat.. slow. It&#39;s intentional.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel describes Jason Calacanis&#39; <a href="http://calacanis.com/2008/07/11/official-announcement-regarding-my-retirement-from-blogging/">cessation of blogging</a> in favor of a private invitation only email list. He claims that it&#39;s a way of reaching people outside the normal domain of blogging. There are certain folks who just don&#39;t read blogs. Joel feels he has totally and utterly saturated the narrow world of programmers who read blogs, so it&#39;s worth experimenting with different distribution mechanisms and perhaps reach different audiences.</p></li>
<li><p>The root of the email problem is that it&#39;s the kitchen sink one-size-fits-all communication medium, when in reality, there should be <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001064.html">communication escalation (or de-escalation)</a> to fit what you&#39;re trying to communicate. Tailor your choice of communication medium to the particular message you are delivering!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071114/144228.shtml">Is email for old people?</a> I do think younger people are correctly intuiting that there are more efficient mechanisms for online communication. As Joel notes, email is really the only canonical form of online communication that <em>everyone</em> is guaranteed to have. You may not have a Twitter or Facebook or Friendster account, but surely you have an email address. Everyone does!</p></li>
<li><p>I am highly skeptical of <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/02/google-buzz-re-invents-gmail.html">the new Google Buzz</a> because it is built on email. You just can&#39;t build a stable structure on top of a broken system, in my humble opinion of course.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of sending mail is also incredibly complicated because spammers have abused the infrastructure for a decade. There are a few immune responses that are still effective, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a> and <a href="http://www.menandmice.com/knowledgehub/dnsqa/56/">Reverse PTR</a> records. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_ID">SenderID</a> is another method, also based on DNS records, but it&#39;s less well regarded. If you&#39;re going to send email and you want it to arrive, you need to implement all this stuff!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel has documented a lot of the process at Fog Creek in a series of training videos and a book, titled <a href="http://training.fogcreek.com/">Make Better Software</a>. Compared to most companies, Fog Creek is quite transparent in this regard, and I might even say they <em>evangelize</em> for better programmer working conditions.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss the promise and peril of Email (both social and technical), Google Buzz, and the value of training material.


I will be at Webstock 2010 and in New Zealand for the next two weeks. I was excited to learn that the singer Wing is from New Zealand. Hear Wing in action. Don't say I didn't warn you. OK, maybe I didn't warn you.
I encouraged Joel to have the Stack Exchange team on for a podcast while I am gone for two weeks. There's a lot of interesting re-engineering of the Stack Overflow engine necessary to support lots of small and medium sites on our engine. If you have questions from the Stack Exchange team, please contribute them to this Meta Stack Exchange thread.
I am not a fan of email, to put it mildly, as I wrote in Is Email = Efail and Email: The Variable Reinforcement Machine. Given my discomfort with email, I struggle with the role of email on Stack Overflow -- mostly trying to keep it at arms' length while using it appropriately.
I agree with Joel's position here, which is that aggressive email notifications are toxic to the growth of a community. That's why our email notifications are somewhat.. slow. It's intentional.
Joel describes Jason Calacanis' cessation of blogging in favor of a private invitation only email list. He claims that it's a way of reaching people outside the normal domain of blogging. There are certain folks who just don't read blogs. Joel feels he has totally and utterly saturated the narrow world of programmers who read blogs, so it's worth experimenting with different distribution mechanisms and perhaps reach different audiences.
The root of the email problem is that it's the kitchen sink one-size-fits-all communication medium, when in reality, there should be communication escalation (or de-escalation) to fit what you're trying to communicate. Tailor your choice of communication medium to the particular message you are delivering!
Is email for old people? I do think younger people are correctly intuiting that there are more efficient mechanisms for online communication. As Joel notes, email is really the only canonical form of online communication that everyone is guaranteed to have. You may not have a Twitter or Facebook or Friendster account, but surely you have an email address. Everyone does!
I am highly skeptical of the new Google Buzz because it is built on email. You just can't build a stable structure on top of a broken system, in my humble opinion of course.
The act of sending mail is also incredibly complicated because spammers have abused the infrastructure for a decade. There are a few immune responses that are still effective, such as DKIM and Reverse PTR records. SenderID is another method, also based on DNS records, but it's less well regarded. If you're going to send email and you want it to arrive, you need to implement all this stuff!
Joel has documented a lot of the process at Fog Creek in a series of training videos and a book, titled Make Better Software. Compared to most companies, Fog Creek is quite transparent in this regard, and I might even say they evangelize for better programmer working conditions.


Our featured questions this week are:


Server Fault:Â What's your recommended server room kit? A nice description of the key items any well provisioned server room ought to have.


We answered the following listener question on this podcast:


Pierre "Good programming training material is expensive. How can students obtain good training materials?"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff sit down with Mac developer Daniel Jalkut of <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater Software</a> to discuss his experience as a longtime Mac developer and small Mac software business owner, and the possible impact of the iPad.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Daniel launched Red Sweater software way back in 1999 (and has been an active Mac developer since 1995), but it didn&#39;t become his primary business until 2005-ish. The big apps in his stable are <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, blog composing software, and <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blackink/">Black Ink</a>, a crossword app. There has been no iPhone version of these OSX apps to date because it wasn&#39;t a good fit, but the iPad is going to be a nearly perfect fit.</p></li>
<li><p>In Daniel&#39;s experience, the primary change in Apple&#39;s software developer support story over the last 15 years is that Apple has become much more pragmatic in adopting developer tools from the UNIX and open source world. Remember when Apple had its own Unix, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX">a/ux</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Apple has a whole new alternative to gcc, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang">clang</a> compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/amazonmacmillan-other-perspect.html">Macmillan-Amazon Kindle incident</a> highlighted how Apple entering the eBook market with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/">iPad and iBooks</a> is actually disruptive in a good way, that benefits both readers and writers.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel agrees that the iPad will probably kill the Kindle hardware. We think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink">e ink</a> is kind of overrated. It&#39;s not clear how much this matters to Amazon.Â It is bizarre that the Kindle app will be allowed to run on the iPad as a competing &quot;app store&quot; next to iBooks.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a little perplexed about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBPnB3noTa8">the existence of iWork for the iPad</a>, since it highlights the main weakness of the iPad -- while touch is great, the inclusion of keyboard support is odd, and I&#39;m not sure how well it&#39;s going to scale to large screens and I think it&#39;s a weak replacement for the mouse paradigm.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I think Steve Jobs never really believed that computers made sense as general purpose devices. Computers should always have been appliances, and the iPhone and iPad are manifestations of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Steven Frank <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/359224392/i-need-to-talk-to-you-about-computers-ive-been">likens the iPad to the new world of computing</a>, a bespoke from the ground up reconception of how computers should work, compared to the classic OSX, Linux, Windows desktop old world.</p></li>
<li><p>Is lack of support for Adobe&#39;s Flash on the iPad the equivalent of dropping the floppy drive from early iMac models? I&#39;d say the floppy drive was already pretty useless by the time Apple dropped it, whereas Flash is <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2010/01/sympathy_for_the_devil.html">still kind of useful in a lot of circumstances</a>, as John Nack notes. Particularly on a large screen device billed as delivering a no-compromises web experience.</p></li>
<li><p>If Apple choosing to make a political statement about dropping Flash (on the iPhone and now iPad) results in <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/02/01/flash-ipad-standards/">websites built with better Flash fallbacks</a> than an empty box on a web page, that is a good thing. It&#39;s just hard for me, personally, to accept that Apple is doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, rather than as a nakedly capitalistic way to protect the income stream from the App Store.</p></li>
<li><p>It has been pointed out to me that Stack Overflow is <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/28642/why-do-i-get-more-satisfaction-out-of-participating-in-so-than-out-of-my-job">powered by bored programmers</a>, so it is in our best interest for programmers to be bored at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel says that being bored says a lot more about a person&#39;s state of mind rather than whether the environment is actually boring. If you&#39;re bored while programming, &quot;you are doing it wrong.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>There are several dimensions to improving questions on any site on the trilogy; primary among those is editing (at 2k rep), and there always is voting to close (at 3k rep), flagging for moderator attention (at 15 rep). And meta-discussion about questions is always welcome on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">meta.stackoverflow.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Community moderation is an important part of our sites, and we&#39;re currently <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/02/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-election-begins/">conducting an election</a> to determine the next Stack Overflow moderator. You do need 200 reputation to have the right to vote, though.</p></li>
<li><p>For more great Mac dev discussion, check out Daniel&#39;s podcast with Manton Reece, <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Jeffrey</strong> &quot;How do you deal with programmers who are intellectually bored at work?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phil</strong> &quot;I spend a fair amount of time on Server Fault, but I&#39;ve seen a lot of new users not providing enough information for us to help them. As a result the signal to noise ratio has dropped. What can be done to improve this?&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>We&#39;ve had some difficulty adapting to GitHub, where the reverse engineering of<a href="http://github.com/derobins/wmd"> the Javascript Markdown (WMD) editor</a> was performed.

<li><p>Joel is writing a series of articles about distributed version control in <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> -- I&#39;m hoping they will clear up some of my confusion about GitHub.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss GitHub, the value of formal code documentation, and how to decide what features belong in the next version of your software.


We've had some difficulty adapting to GitHub, where the reverse engineering of the Javascript Markdown (WMD) editor was performed. It regularly confuses everyone that encounters it, and that's frustrating from a support perspective.
For example, why does the MangOS project on GitHub have 854 branches? How is that useful to anyone? The project network is so complex it can't even be rendered! What I specifically object to is that all pulls show up in the timeline as forks; I'd like to see an ability to nominate your pull timeline as either private or "not intended for merging" so it won't show up in the main network.
Joel is writing a series of articles about distributed version control in Mercurial -- I'm hoping they will clear up some of my confusion about GitHub. I personally find Google Code much easier to work with.
As part of MarkdownSharp, our open source C# Markdown implementation, I've experimented a bit with turning a regex into a state machine -- and I was a bit shocked how many lines of code it takes to "unroll" a regex. Is it really easier to troubleshoot 25 individual lines of state machine code (all with potential bugs) or 3 single line regular expressions?
Stack Overflow user William Shields has taken up Joel's challenge to write a Markdown parser the right way -- and produced an excellent series of articles about what he's learned in the process: one, two, three, four. It's a perfect example of the type of learning that Stack Overflow itself is all about; kudos to William for sharing it!
Joel and I have mixed feelings about documenting a large code base. Rather than wasting time generating reams of documentation that may never be read, and will rapidly get out of date -- we offer some alternatives. Come up with a unit test suite that lives symbiotically with the code, or spend time documenting the key, central data structures instead of the code. Also, have the new hire guys and gals who encounter the code be in charge of keeping the "how do I get started with this stuff?" bootstrapping information up to date.
Joel says the least amount of work you need to do to capture how many hours are spent on programming tasks, is to make each source code checkin assume that all time since the previous checkin was spent on whatever the current task is.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss open sourcing Markdown, the necessity of barriers on the open internet, and the importance of design in the software process.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We highlight three interesting Stack Exchange sites: <a href="http://community.climatedeal.org/">Climate Deal</a> (environmental climate change issues), <a href="http://answers.ascom-standards.org">ASCOM Answers</a> (astronomy tech), and <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">Math Overflow</a> (professional mathematicians).</p></li>
<li><p>Thanks to <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/users/1/anton-geraschenko">Anton Geraschenko</a> (the operator of Math Overflow, who I erroneously, embarrassingly, and <em>repeatedly</em> refer to as &quot;Jacob&quot; in this podcast -- my apologies) for his help with improving our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wmd-new/">client side Markdown implementation</a>. We also have a server side implementation of Markdown, which is now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/">open sourced at Google Code</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original Markdown implementation</a> was in Perl. As a result, there is an unfortunate tradition in the community of writing Markdown parsers using a slew of regular expressions. This leads to some rather dense and complicated code with a lot of hairy edge conditions. Like most Perl, it worked well for the 95% case but that last 5% is extraordinarily difficult to achieve.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel argues that if the community had started out writing a proper Markdown parser using standard tools like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">Yacc</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison">Bison</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_programming_tool">Lex</a> would have produced much simpler, easier to maintain code. I tend to agree that this is kind of a textbook example of where &quot;the right way&quot; would have perhaps been easier in the long run than the quick and dirty hack.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/browse/trunk/MarkdownSharpTests/source/php/markdown.php#365">core HTML block parser</a> in the much better maintained PHP implementation. It is three full screens .. of a single regular expression. This is the most complex regular expression I&#39;ve ever seen that was not a joke of some kind, and it&#39;s the core of the PHP Markdown implementation. Compiling this enormous regex in .NET causes my super-fast machine to freeze for several seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Running an open source project has reminded me of Derek Sivers classic article -- <a href="http://sivers.org/up2you">Nobody&#39;s going to help you. Does that encourage you or discourage you?</a> You have to be more dedicated to your open source project than anyone else in the world. Your dedication will inspire others to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately, blessing something as open source does not magically synthesize leadership. This is why I was <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001317.html">a bit critical of John Gruber&#39;s handling of Markdown</a>, as I felt the lack of action was starting to harm Markdown. Regardless, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-gives-back/">we donated to Markdown</a> along with all the other parts of our development stack that we rely on. We hope to make these donations a yearly tradition.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that you should have no barrier to participation on the open internet isn&#39;t just a myth, it&#39;s a dangerous and destructive myth. We believe you need a barrier to keep those people who aren&#39;t serious out. For example, <a href="http://blog.citizendium.org/?p=233">Wikipedia intentionally does this</a>. We aren&#39;t talking about a concrete wall lined with razor wire, but a toddler sized barrier to keep the most bored and uninteresting users (or, if you prefer, &quot;the majority of the internet&quot;) away.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel explains why he no longer believes in outsourcing design; they are <a href="http://fogcreek.com/Jobs/Design.html">hiring a designer</a> to work at Fog Creek full time. We compare the differences in the hiring process for designers versus programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>Our philosophy of design on Stack Overflow is to try to do as little as possible, but make those few things polished as we can. While there&#39;s always room for improvement, and we love whitespace and minimalism, there is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000644.html">an issue of information density</a> that is totally intentional -- particularly on the homepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Item number 11 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joel_Test">the Joel Test</a> ensures that you work for a company where they ask candidates to write code during the interview. The essential part here is not the production of the code, per se, but observation of the work actually happening. You need to know how the sausage is produced.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a website that conducts programming tests on the internet for you at <a href="http://codility.com/">Codility</a>, but we&#39;re skeptical this can actually work without the one-on-one human element of observation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered two listener questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Evan</strong>: &quot;why do you feel it is necessary to charge programmers to list CVs? Won&#39;t this prevent the service from reaching critical mass?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Part of the Joel Test is writing code during the interview. How do you feel about companies who ask programmers to submit code samples or take home programming assignments?&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

Thanks to Anton Geraschenko (the operator of Math Overflow, who I erroneously, embarrassingly, and repeatedly refer to as "Jacob" in this podcast -- my apologies) for his help with improving our client side Markdown implementation. We also have a server side implementation of Markdown, which is now open sourced at Google Code.
The original Markdown implementation was in Perl. As a result, there is an unfortunate tradition in the community of writing Markdown parsers using a slew of regular expressions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff sit down with Paul, David, and Matthew -- the creators of Litmus and DocType -- to discuss ASCII vs. pixels, the power of Amazon EC2, and the unglamorous but critically important topic of backup.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The fine folks at <a href="http://litmusapp.com/">Litmus</a> created <a href="http://doctype.com/">DocType</a> partly as a homage to the Stack Overflow engine. We were so impressed we invited them into our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/">League of Web Justice</a>. You can view DocType as the intersection of what Litmus does (screenshots of browsers and email clients rendering HTML) and what Stack Overflow does (Q&amp;A).</p></li>
<li><p>Where the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">Stack Overflow Trilogy</a> is about programmers, sysadmins, and power users exercising ASCII text, DocType and Litmus is about designers exercising pixels. It&#39;s not an audience we can satisfy particularly well, which is why we were happy to partner up. It&#39;s all about getting good, effective answers to your questions, regardless of which site provides those answers.</p></li>
<li><p>A bit on the technical underpinnings of Litmus. This app has to generate screenshots from a ton of different <a href="http://litmusapp.com/email-testing">email clients</a> and a ton of <a href="http://litmusapp.com/browser-testing">different browsers</a>, for both Macs and PCs. The PC side is served by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> instances, which was an incredible boon for this type of work. They actually scale up to 400 EC2 instances at peak load times.</p></li>
<li><p>The original version of Litmus was built using nothing but scripting on a single machine, but was enough to get customers. They were effectively running on a prototype; the entire app has been rearchitected several times since then.</p></li>
<li><p>DocType is built mostly in Ruby on Rails, and Litmus is a combination of C# and Ruby on Rails. In that sense, they also reflect the platform agnostic spirit of Stack Overflow.   </p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of the state of the DocType community. One point of integration between the two sites is that people having difficulty solving layouts problems via the screenshot service in Litmus are encouraged to ask for help on DocType.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel points out that one way to get a critical mass of core users is to get some kind of sponsorship or mention by people who have large audiences. For example, if you&#39;re starting a music site, try to get <a href="http://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a> to mention you or, better yet, become the godfather of your site. Anyway, always have the goal of making something that is useful to <em>somebody</em> -- and start with yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>We are a little tired of the backup topic at this point, but maybe it&#39;s a good thing to remind people that every day is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html">International Backup Awareness Day</a>, and it never hurts to revisit your own backup practices, as we did with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/blog-outage-backup-policies/">our Stack Overflow backup policies</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/2888/why-is-raid-not-a-backup">RAID is not a backup</a>, but I sure do wish the server which experienced the hard drive failure had some kind of basic mirroring in place to protect against exactly this kind of routine, mundane drive failure. The moving parts are what tend to fail, which is why all our Stack Overflow servers use RAID.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel elaborates a bit on the importance of focusing on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/12/14.html">recovery versus backup</a>. There are a lot of ways a valid &quot;backup&quot; can go horribly wrong, and you will never know any of that until you actively restore a backup.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our featured questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>DocType: <a href="http://doctype.com/does-doctype-generate-screenshots-use-site">How does Doctype generate the screenshots they use on the site?</a> A nice description of the ImageMagick commands used to generate the nifty little DocType screenshot thumbnails.</p></li>
<li><p>SuperUser: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/82036/recovering-a-lost-website-with-no-backup">Recovering a lost website with no backup?</a> The short vc&quot;go back in time and do proper backups.&quot; The long version is, &quot;How patient are you?&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Travis</strong> from Wisconsin: &quot;I have a music based Stack Exchange site called <a href="http://keyminor.com/">keyminor.com</a>. I have a ton of questions I plan to seed the site with, and I have a bunch of users I plan to approach for assistance. What&#39;s the best elevator pitch for getting people to understand and check out a Stack Exchange site?&quot;<br></li>
</ol>

The original version of Litmus was built using nothing but scripting on a single machine, but was enough to get customers. They were effectively running on a prototype; the entire app has been rearchitected several times since then.
DocType is built mostly in Ruby on Rails, and Litmus is a combination of C# and Ruby on Rails. In that sense, they also reflect the platform agnostic spirit of Stack Overflow.   
A brief discussion of the state of the DocType community. One point of integration between the two sites is that people having difficulty solving layouts problems via the screenshot service in Litmus are encouraged to ask for help on DocType.
Joel points out that one way to get a critical mass of core users is to get some kind of sponsorship or mention by people who have large audiences. For example, if you're starting a music site, try to get Derek Sivers to mention you or, better yet, become the godfather of your site. Anyway, always have the goal of making something that is useful to somebody -- and start with yourself.
We are a little tired of the backup topic at this point, but maybe it's a good thing to remind people that every day is International Backup Awareness Day, and it never hurts to revisit your own backup practices, as we did with our Stack Overflow backup policies.
RAID is not a backup, but I sure do wish the server which experienced the hard drive failure had some kind of basic mirroring in place to protect against exactly this kind of routine, mundane drive failure. The moving parts are what tend to fail, which is why all our Stack Overflow servers use RAID.
Joel elaborates a bit on the importance of focusing on recovery versus backup. There are a lot of ways a valid "backup" can go horribly wrong, and you will never know any of that until you actively restore a backup.  


Our featured questions this week are:


DocType: How does Doctype generate the screenshots they use on the site? A nice description of the ImageMagick commands used to generate the nifty little DocType screenshot thumbnails.
SuperUser: Recovering a lost website with no backup? The short vc"go back in time and do proper backups." The long version is, "How patient are you?"


We answered the following listener question on this podcast:


Travis from Wisconsin: "I have a music based Stack Exchange site called keyminor.com. I have a ton of questions I plan to seed the site with, and I have a bunch of users I plan to approach for assistance. What's the best elevator pitch for getting people to understand and check out a Stack Exchange site?"

Just as a disaster planning exercise, what kind of things could happen that would destroy your software business? Your website?  
Joel proposes doing test failovers for live customers. He says the important metric isn't measuring how long you are down, but how fast you can recover from being down.
How much down time per month is acceptable for a service? What's your agreement with your customers? Does a free service even have "customers"?

<li><p>One thing we have resisted is employer demand for a sort order of CVs by Stack Overflow reputation scores. This is sort of like colleges sorting incoming applications by SAT or ACT scores. We have a brief discussion about how the college admissions process relates (or doesn&#39;t) to job &quot;admissions&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel shares his tips on what makes a CV / resume look good to him. And remember,<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590598385"> Joel wrote the book on this stuff</a>! So in theory, at least, he knows what he&#39;s talking about! Fog Creek does a lot of hiring every year.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that we have a so-called &quot;Careers&quot; site on Stack Overflow, any perceived crossover between your professional life and online life is 100% intentional and by design -- <a href="http://www.cerebralmastication.com/?p=370">as correctly noted by the Cerebral Mastication blog</a>.</p></li>

It went hyper-viral.</p></li>
<li><p>Should we allow Facebook questions (or other questions specific to a website) on Super User? It&#39;s <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/30475/official-stance-on-facebook-questions-on-su">a bit complicated</a> because websites are becoming legitimate &quot;software applications&quot; in today&#39;s computing world, and even more so in the future. The line between a traditional software executable and a website is becoming less and less clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussing how you scale a community on Stack Exchange -- is it about having lots and lots of questions, or garnering a solid audience of experts?</p></li>
<li><p>There appears to be a distinct difference between the early, adolescent, and mature stages of a community. You have to plan for and adapt to each stage; there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. I&#39;m reminded of Robert X. Cringely&#39;s classic essay <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000025.html">Commandos, Infantry, and Police</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s counterpoint is that <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26064">maybe you&#39;re actually working with Sid Meier</a>. My counterpoint: everyone <em>wants</em> to think they&#39;re Sid Meier, but as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28film%29">Highlander</a>, &quot;There can be only one&quot;.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Jeff sit down with sysadmin extraordinaire Tom Limoncelli of <a href="http://EverythingSysadmin.com">Everything Sysadmin</a> to discuss IPV6, dumb things for System Administrators to check, and the sysadmin community as reflected in <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tom has written some classic sysadmin books such as <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596007833/tomontime-20">Time Management for System Administrators</a>, <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0321492668/tomontime-20">The Practice of System and Network Administration</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of the <a href="http://www.rfchumor.com">April Fool&#39;s RFCs</a>, which go back every year to 1989 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_RFC">per wikipedia</a>. There are even some outliers in the seventies, starting with <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc527">ARPAWOCKY</a>. These aren&#39;t just humor, but artifacts of computing history.</p></li>
<li><p>Tom shares his thoughts on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPV6</a> transition -- where we are, how much progress we&#39;ve made, and some of the practical rationales for going to IPV6. What problem does IPV6 solve for us today?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve often wondered: is the last address space transition we&#39;ll see in our lifetime the one from 32-bit to 64-bit? Are 128-bit address spaces necessary for system memory? I press Tom on this topic. He notes that the IPV6 committee was originally going to pick a 64-bit address space, but doubled it to 128-bit.</p></li>
<li><p>We examine Tom&#39;s hilarious and excellent <a href="http://whatexit.org/tal/mywritings/dumb-things-to-check.html">list of dumb things to check</a>. I guarantee that parts of this list will seem eerily familiar to you.</p></li>
<li><p>We attempt to enlist Tom&#39;s help in measuring the boundaries of <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>. This is challenging, because the sysadmin world encompasses security, networking, databases, websites, hardware, and general operations and support.</p></li>
<li><p>We had great difficulty pinning down the sysadmin community, in contrast with the programming community. Tom is as close as we&#39;ve ever come to the &quot;Joel Spolsky&quot; of the sysadmin world. Tom points out that there is some natural overlap between programmers and system administrators, mostly in the area of release management. Beyond that, there are groups like <a href="http://lopsa.org/">LOPSA</a>, <a href="http://www.npanet.org/">NPANET</a>, and <a href="http://www.sage.org/">SAGE</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tom notes that if you have a small site that can be served by one box, any stack will do. If you have a medium site that needs hundreds of requests per second, go with what your team knows best. But beyond that, once you get the hundreds of thousands of queries per second, everyone builds a custom solution. You do want to think seriously about optimizing for the decreasing price of commodity hardware, however.  </p></li>
<li><p>Somehow I hadn&#39;t seen the classic sysadmin comedy routine <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N38a5ja26xY&amp;fmt=18">The Website is Down</a> yet until Tom mentioned it. There&#39;s a series of videos at the <a href="http://www.thewebsiteisdown.com/">eponymously named website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you fancy yourself a Google-scale computing endeavor, or if you are simply interested in the ultimate sysadmin fantasy, definitely read <a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00193ED1V01Y200905CAC006">Google&#39;s Guide to Warehouse-Scale Computing</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener question:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Arnold</strong>: &quot;How feasible is it to host a new web application using the Microsoft stack, considering scalability, performance, and cost versus the open source alternatives.&quot;<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite questions this week -- from <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a> naturally!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/52671/how-do-i-create-unicode-smilies-like"></a><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/20356/professional-groups-and-associations">Sysadmin Professional Groups and Associations</a>. An excellent resource.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/data-center">Data Center</a> tag is awfully good reading for anyone who has a server room.</p></li>
</ul>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Joel and Jeff sit down with sysadmin extraordinaire Tom Limoncelli of Everything Sysadmin to discuss IPV6, dumb things for System Administrators to check, and the sysadmin community as reflected in Server Fault.


Tom has written some classic sysadmin books such as Time Management for System Administrators, The Practice of System and Network Administration.
A brief discussion of the April Fool's RFCs, which go back every year to 1989 per wikipedia. There are even some outliers in the seventies, starting with ARPAWOCKY. These aren't just humor, but artifacts of computing history.
Tom shares his thoughts on the IPV6 transition -- where we are, how much progress we've made, and some of the practical rationales for going to IPV6. What problem does IPV6 solve for us today?
I've often wondered: is the last address space transition we'll see in our lifetime the one from 32-bit to 64-bit? Are 128-bit address spaces necessary for system memory? I press Tom on this topic. He notes that the IPV6 committee was originally going to pick a 64-bit address space, but doubled it to 128-bit.
We examine Tom's hilarious and excellent list of dumb things to check. I guarantee that parts of this list will seem eerily familiar to you.
We attempt to enlist Tom's help in measuring the boundaries of Server Fault. This is challenging, because the sysadmin world encompasses security, networking, databases, websites, hardware, and general operations and support.
We had great difficulty pinning down the sysadmin community, in contrast with the programming community. Tom is as close as we've ever come to the "Joel Spolsky" of the sysadmin world. Tom points out that there is some natural overlap between programmers and system administrators, mostly in the area of release management. Beyond that, there are groups like LOPSA, NPANET, and SAGE.
Tom notes that if you have a small site that can be served by one box, any stack will do. If you have a medium site that needs hundreds of requests per second, go with what your team knows best. But beyond that, once you get the hundreds of thousands of queries per second, everyone builds a custom solution. You do want to think seriously about optimizing for the decreasing price of commodity hardware, however.  
Somehow I hadn't seen the classic sysadmin comedy routine The Website is Down yet until Tom mentioned it. There's a series of videos at the eponymously named website.
If you fancy yourself a Google-scale computing endeavor, or if you are simply interested in the ultimate sysadmin fantasy, definitely read Google's Guide to Warehouse-Scale Computing.


We answered the following listener question:


Thomas Arnold: "How feasible is it to host a new web application using the Microsoft stack, considering scalability, performance, and cost versus the open source alternatives."


Our favorite questions this week -- from Server Fault naturally!


Sysadmin Professional Groups and Associations. An excellent resource.
The Data Center tag is awfully good reading for anyone who has a server room.

<ul>
<li><p>A brief mini post-mortem of <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/">DevDays</a>. What makes a good conference? What makes a worthwhile event for software developers?</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of conferences, Joel and I will both be at <a href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">the Business of Software conference</a> next week in San Francisco.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of Robert Scoble&#39;s article on <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/11/02/the-chat-roomforum-problem-an-apology-to-technosailor/">the chat room / forum problem</a>. Some of this stuff is counter-intuitive: you don&#39;t actually want to be too welcoming to newbies, and you don&#39;t actually want too much pure discussion. As Robert said, &quot;the more conversations I got involved in the less I found I was learning.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>I object a little bit to people proposing social design patterns to me that are historically demonstrated not to work -- or, worse, are known to be toxic. Essentially, they offer opinions without any research or even knowledge of prior research in the field.</p></li>
<li><p>We examine Joel&#39;s latest Inc article, <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091101/does-slow-growth-equal-slow-death.html">Does Slow Growth Equal Slow Death?</a>. 37 Signals responded in <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2002-bug-tracking-isnt-a-network-effect-business">their blog</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I both tried to explain our careers strategy. I think <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/11/05.html">Joel&#39;s post on careers.stackoverflow.com</a> was clearer than <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001308.html">my post on careers.stackoverflow.com</a>, in that I had to post an update to mine because I failed to explain it adequately -- at least based on the reader comments.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent that careers is focusing people on &quot;how can I be more professional online?&quot; we heartily encourage this side-effect. Why wouldn&#39;t you behave professionally online all the time, anyway? It is possible to have fun while being professional at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>We posted the results of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/11/our-amazon-advertising-experiment/">our Amazon advertising experiment</a>. It looks like software developers are a worst-case scenario for some types of advertising. Unfortunately.  </p></li>
<li><p>You can use free to undermine your competitors, but Google is going them one better -- they are <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2009/10/29/google-redefines-disruption-the-%E2%80%9Cless-than-free%E2%80%9D-business-model/">paying companies to use their products</a>. It&#39;s &quot;less than free&quot;. Google&#39;s strategy is to get as many people online as possible, since more people online equals more ad clicks, statistically speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s an interesting tension between the &quot;charge for stuff&quot; (Microsoft) and &quot;give people ad-subsidized stuff for free&quot; (Google) models. Having been on both sides of this now, there are definite pros and cons to both.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I concur: it probably doesn&#39;t matter what language and toolchain you use, as long as it has a certain level of critical mass. What you should be more concerned about is the product you&#39;re creating.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re happy with your current tool chain, then there&#39;s no reason you need to switch. However, if you can&#39;t list five things you hate about your favorite programming language, then I argue you don&#39;t know it well enough yet to judge. It&#39;s good to be aware of the alternatives, and have a healthy critical eye for whatever it is you&#39;re using.</p></li>
<li><p>Most programming languages don&#39;t evolve particularly well over time. They&#39;re usually replaced by other languages rather than new iterations of themselves. Why? What languages would you point to as the best example of growing and evolving in useful, relevant ways?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Edward</strong>: &quot;What fun technologies are coming up that you think employers are willing to spend money on?&quot;  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colin</strong>: &quot;If I&#39;m happy with PHP, why would I want to convert to ASP.NET?&quot;</p></li>

A brief mini post-mortem of DevDays. What makes a good conference? What makes a worthwhile event for software developers?
Speaking of conferences, Joel and I will both be at the Business of Software conference next week in San Francisco.
A discussion of Robert Scoble's article on the chat room / forum problem. Some of this stuff is counter-intuitive: you don't actually want to be too welcoming to newbies, and you don't actually want too much pure discussion. As Robert said, "the more conversations I got involved in the less I found I was learning."
I object a little bit to people proposing social design patterns to me that are historically demonstrated not to work -- or, worse, are known to be toxic. Essentially, they offer opinions without any research or even knowledge of prior research in the field.
We examine Joel's latest Inc article, Does Slow Growth Equal Slow Death?. 37 Signals responded in their blog. 
Joel and I both tried to explain our careers strategy. I think Joel's post on careers.stackoverflow.com was clearer than my post on careers.stackoverflow.com, in that I had to post an update to mine because I failed to explain it adequately -- at least based on the reader comments.
To the extent that careers is focusing people on "how can I be more professional online?" we heartily encourage this side-effect. Why wouldn't you behave professionally online all the time, anyway? It is possible to have fun while being professional at the same time.
We posted the results of our Amazon advertising experiment. It looks like software developers are a worst-case scenario for some types of advertising. Unfortunately.  
You can use free to undermine your competitors, but Google is going them one better -- they are paying companies to use their products. It's "less than free". Google's strategy is to get as many people online as possible, since more people online equals more ad clicks, statistically speaking.
There's an interesting tension between the "charge for stuff" (Microsoft) and "give people ad-subsidized stuff for free" (Google) models. Having been on both sides of this now, there are definite pros and cons to both.
Joel and I concur: it probably doesn't matter what language and toolchain you use, as long as it has a certain level of critical mass. What you should be more concerned about is the product you're creating.
If you're happy with your current tool chain, then there's no reason you need to switch.

<ul>
<li><p>A brief audio snippet of Jon&#39;s presentation at <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/london/">London DevDays</a>, featuring Tony the Pony and his sidekick.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of the Google London offices, which aren&#39;t quite up to Joel&#39;s high standards, but are quite fun in their own right. And, they do offer free unlimited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Wurly">Curly Wurlies</a>! The London office mostly does mobile development, which in Google world is <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel explains his analogy of software development as a biology-based process, instead of a physics-based process.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430219483/?tag=codinghorror-20">Coders at Work</a>, Peter Norvig -- chief research guy at Google -- explains that his definition of correctness in software now mostly involves statistics intervals, not absolute boolean &quot;this is right&quot;, &quot;this is wrong&quot; tests.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of Joel&#39;s painful 14 line AppleScript odyssey.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a wall -- literally -- of hundreds of mobile phones at Google London that they use to test against. We wonder how Google&#39;s Android will avoid devolving into the same miasma of dozens or hundreds of different versions of hardware, all of which behave differently and require special software support or workarounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Is Apple becoming to mobile apps what Microsoft was, and is, to desktop PC apps? Will success in future mobile devices _require _an iPhone emulation layer? Although Apple unquestionably deserves their success with the iPhone, Joel and I are deeply concerned that too much Apple dominance in this area is bad for developers, as Apple serves developers poorly.</p></li>
<li><p>Jon spends a lot of time dealing with date and time issues, and shares one particularly horrifying timezone example. Apparently, time is often ambiguous and subject to change by human processes that aren&#39;t ... entirely rational.</p></li>
<li><p>It is OK to have &quot;fun&quot; questions on Stack Overflow, but a) only occasionally, as we can&#39;t have the system overrun by pure entertainment and b) the question must be legitimately programming related and accepted by the community. As with so many things in life, moderation is key.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re Jon Skeet, you can <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/555/why-does-jon-skeet-never-sleep/566#566">post your schedule on meta</a> and it will get 40+ upvotes. Mind you, there is no technical answer there, it&#39;s just Jon&#39;s schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>The daily reputation cap is partly there to encourage programmers to take a break. The goal isn&#39;t to be on Stack Overflow, but to generally do things that make you a better programmer. While that certainly includes the fractional time slices of questions and answers that programmers so generously contribute, it also means doing your job, and writing code! To the extent that Stack Overflow itself becomes the goal, we are failing you.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our listener question this week is from ... Jon Skeet!</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the reputation cap (currently 200 points per day) time based? Would other forms of capping reputation work better or be more preferable?<br></li>

Ad-hoc roundtable podcast with Scott, Rory, Joel, and Jeff backstage at DevDays. Warning: extreme ramblosity ahead!
Joel explains his Duct Tape Programmer post. Apparently DevDays is a duct tape conference, and this section of the recording is a duct tape podcast.
Some discussion of the ubiquity of mobile code. Also, if you are nostalgic for the era "when development was hard", the consensus is that you should be doing mobile development today on iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, or Symbian.
Rory elaborates on his experience with (and effusive opinions on)  iPhone development to date. Is coding in Objective-C best accompanied by a flux capacitor, New Coke, and Max Headroom? Also, his excitement for MonoTouch.
Joel and Scott put on their amateur language designer hats and have a spirited discussion of type inference and Fog Creek's in-house DSL, Wasabi.
Scott covers some of the highlights of new and shiny features coming in the Visual Studio 2010 IDE, the C# 4.0 language, and the ASP.NET MVC 2.0 web framework.

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> is now officially in public beta! There are a <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4/list-of-stackexchange-sites">huge number of sites</a> running on the Stack Overflow engine. Far more than I expected at this early stage, anyway.  </p></li>
<li><p>The Stack Exchange sites are pushing the boundaries of the specific audience (that is, programmers) we designed it for. Consider the audience overlap between <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/">answers.onstartups.com</a>, <a href="http://www.epicadvice.com/">epicadvice.com</a>, and <a href="http://moms4mom.com/">moms4mom.com</a>. I was getting usability reports from my wife on that last one, which was quite surreal. Also surreal: that Jon Skeet is a top user on one of the above. You&#39;ll never guess which one!</p></li>
<li><p>Do some of the Stack Exchange sites compete with Stack Overflow? Such as <a href="http://ask.sqlteam.com/">ask.sqlteam.com</a> and <a href="http://snippetgood.com/">snippetgood.com</a>? Not necessarily; if you&#39;re particularly enthusiastic about some niche, you&#39;ll get more questions and tighter focus of community by going to site dedicated to that topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel feels that Stack Exchange works so well as a support forum that he&#39;s shutting down all the other online FogBugz web support tools in favor of <a href="http://fogbugz.stackexchange.com/">fogbugz.stackexchange.com</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the minimum number of knowledgeable, invested users you need to have a functional online Q&amp;A community? Joel says one (!). I think it&#39;s more on the order of a few dozen. The software part is easy, the real hurdle is this: can you rustle together a core community of a few dozen enthusiastic, knowledgeable folks?</p></li>
<li><p>An extended discussion of our new careers section of Stack Overflow, which <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/10/introducing-stack-overflow-careers/">we launched last week</a>. Joel sort of wrote the book on this topic, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1590598385/?tag=codinghorror-20">Smart and Gets Things Done: Joel Spolsky&#39;s Concise Guide to Finding the Best Technical Talent</a>. Our careers approach grows out of Joel (and my) dissatisfaction with the current status quo. It sucks, and we&#39;d like to build something better.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the philosophy behind <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a> : smart companies should be pursuing good programmers, and not the other way around. We also want to cut out the cheesy for-pay contingency recruiters (or any other middlemen, for that matter) from the mix, and directly connect passionate programmers with companies that understand the value of programmers who <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">hit the high notes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>This is Fog Creek&#39;s guarantee for every service they charge money for: &quot;The Fog Creek Promise: If you&#39;re not satisfied, for any reason, within 90 days you get a full refund, period, no questions asked. We don&#39;t want your money if you&#39;re not amazingly happy.&quot; Stack Overflow has adopted this promise as well. Why don&#39;t all companies do this? Why would you want to keep an unsatisfied customer&#39;s money -- it generates ill will <em>far</em> out of proportion to the tiny amount of money involved.</p></li>
<li><p>As a part of careers, we&#39;re planning to roll out free, public CVs with user-selectable &quot;vanity&quot; URLs in a week or two. In retrospect, we should have done this from day one, as it compliments the public record of your Q&amp;A on Stack Overflow. As Joel notes, the best way to control your online presence is to fill it yourself with all the cool stuff you&#39;ve been doing! Don&#39;t let others tell the story of you when you can tell it yourself.</p></li>

Stack Exchange is now officially in public beta! There are a huge number of sites running on the Stack Overflow engine. Far more than I expected at this early stage, anyway.  
The Stack Exchange sites are pushing the boundaries of the specific audience (that is, programmers) we designed it for. Consider the audience overlap between answers.onstartups.com, epicadvice.com, and moms4mom.com. I was getting usability reports from my wife on that last one, which was quite surreal. Also surreal: that Jon Skeet is a top user on one of the above. You'll never guess which one!
Do some of the Stack Exchange sites compete with Stack Overflow? Such as ask.sqlteam.com and snippetgood.com? Not necessarily; if you're particularly enthusiastic about some niche, you'll get more questions and tighter focus of community by going to site dedicated to that topic.
Joel feels that Stack Exchange works so well as a support forum that he's shutting down all the other online FogBugz web support tools in favor of fogbugz.stackexchange.com.  
What's the minimum number of knowledgeable, invested users you need to have a functional online Q&A community? Joel says one (!). I think it's more on the order of a few dozen.

An extended discussion of our new careers section of Stack Overflow, which we launched last week.

Peter agrees with Joel that concurrent (threaded) programming is some of the hardest programming anyone can do -- even the extraordinary programmers he interviewed concur on this point.  
Susan Lammers' book Programmers at Work was the early inspiration for Coders at Work. It's a similarly fantastic read. The other book in the same series, Founders at Work, is a great (albeit less technical) too.
Many of the programmers interviewed (with the lone exception of Brad Fitzpatrick) got their start before home microcomputers such as the Apple II were even available. But they all spent deep, huge hands-on volumes of time on a computer, somehow.
One big sea change in the last 30 years of programming: per Jamie Zawinski, "these days, almost all software is social software". The days of the solitary, disconnected programmer toiling away in a server room are essentially over.
Even a hardcore game programmer like John Carmack (who, sadly, could not be reached for interview in Peter's book) has gone on record with a back to basics approach: "if I were off by myself, I would want to become an iPhone game developer."

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Jeff discuss outsourced DNS, virtual machine &quot;appliances&quot;, and programmers as library users versus library writers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As a dyed in the wool fan of <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/">fake plastic rock</a>, I am required by law to mention that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=beatles%20rock%20band&amp;tag=codinghorror-20&amp;index=videogames&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Beatles: Rock Band</a> was released last week. It&#39;s great!</p></li>
<li><p>We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/new-dns-provider/">changed DNS providers</a>, as our existing registrar&#39;s DNS service was highly ... irregular.</p></li>
<li><p>Should you pay for outsourced, dedicated DNS? What do you get for that money? What kinds of value can outsourced DNS provide? What clever things can a smart DNS provider do?</p></li>
<li><p>If you need to troubleshoot your DNS, try <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/">DNS Stuff</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>DNS is heavily cached throughout the internet, but I think we overestimate how efficient these distributed caches are. For example, Yahoo found that <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/04/performance-research-part-2/">40-60 percent of their users</a> have an empty browser cache experience. There is value in having a fast, distributed core service for the no-cache scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of our use of virtual machines in our little server farm. Since the only trouble spot for VM performance is disk, that gives us the flexibility of using a lot of great Linux and open source tools for networking (no or very little disk dependency), such as <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> and <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes people <em>should</em> question the premise of your question; as in <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/64232/dead-gateway-detection-on-windows-2008-server">our Server Fault question about having two default gateways</a>, it turns out that the only sane answer is &quot;don&#39;t do that.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>, the broader the topic, and the more unanswerable questions you have, the worse the engine will do for you.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Joel and Jeff discuss outsourced DNS, virtual machine "appliances", and programmers as library users versus library writers.


As a dyed in the wool fan of fake plastic rock, I am required by law to mention that The Beatles: Rock Band was released last week. It's great!
We changed DNS providers, as our existing registrar's DNS service was highly ... irregular.
Should you pay for outsourced, dedicated DNS? What do you get for that money? What kinds of value can outsourced DNS provide? What clever things can a smart DNS provider do?
If you need to troubleshoot your DNS, try DNS Stuff.
DNS is heavily cached throughout the internet, but I think we overestimate how efficient these distributed caches are. For example, Yahoo found that 40-60 percent of their users have an empty browser cache experience. There is value in having a fast, distributed core service for the no-cache scenario.
A brief discussion of our use of virtual machines in our little server farm. Since the only trouble spot for VM performance is disk, that gives us the flexibility of using a lot of great Linux and open source tools for networking (no or very little disk dependency), such as HAProxy and Cacti.
Sometimes people should question the premise of your question; as in our Server Fault question about having two default gateways, it turns out that the only sane answer is "don't do that."
When it comes to Stack Exchange, the broader the topic, and the more unanswerable questions you have, the worse the engine will do for you. The engine is designed for reasonably narrow topics, with a majority of questions that can actually be answered in some reasonable way.
Joel likens the classic divide in software developers to "library users versus library writers". At what point do programmers cross that chasm? Do they need to? Joel says "we write one algorithm per year."
How do you deal with the dancing bunnies problem? Also known as the Dancing pigs problem. "Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time."


We answered the following listener questions this week:


Steve: "The etiquette rules for meta are much looser than on the other Trilogy sites. Does this have ramifications for Stack Exchange sites?"
Brian: "Technology changes so fast that most developers burn out in 20 years. How do we retain our historical knowledge if the rate of attrition is so high?"


Our favorite questions this week:


How can I gently explain to non-techie friends they are the victim of a hoax? It is part of the responsibility of a true superuser to tend to those users who can't protect themselves.
What is the worst real-world macros/pre-processor abuse you've ever come across? The C, she is dangerous!

<li><p>Joel feels that what Craig Newmark is doing with Craigslist is a brand of evil, in that it has destroyed the income stream (classified ads) that supported professional journalism.

<li><p>We officially disabled the built in ASP.NET Session state, so as to set ourselves up for multiple Stack Overflow servers. Fortunately, we don&#39;t need a lot of shared state, but we were using it in a few places. We created a small database table to store the small bits of per-user state that we need.</p></li>

<li><p>To switch over to multiple servers, we need some kind of load balancer. We chose <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a>, but we also had to configure tproxy (transparent proxy) support so that the IP addresses arriving at the web servers are not all the same.</p></li>
<li><p>For now we&#39;ll be load balancing using a simple hash of the incoming IP address. Depending on which hash you get, you may end up on a different server, but you&#39;ll stay on that server as long as your IP address is stable. This is a fairly crude form of balancing, but should be sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s incredible how aggressive Google&#39;s indexing of our site is; it regularly pulls down a gigabyte of compressed text from us per day, and it wants to do even more. One of the primary motivators for adding a second server is to reduce the traffic load enough so that we can &quot;unleash&quot; google via <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">webmaster tools</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A belated welcome to our newest and third site in the trilogy, <a href="http://superuser.com/">Super User</a> -- it&#39;s for any general computer software or hardware questions, but we&#39;ve already had to disallow videogaming questions.</p></li>
<li><p>How much overlap will there be between our public websites, and the sites launched through the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange service</a>? But remember, the software (however great it may be) is the easy part. Building a community is the truly difficult part! To succeed, that&#39;s what you should focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel discusses the shifting meaning of &quot;Beta&quot; -- it&#39;s been contorted into &quot;the first five years of a product&quot;. But there is an art to the classic beta, in terms of releasing in a staggered fashion to fresh testers who haven&#39;t seen it yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Google&#39;s self-support model is often unsatisfying because it is community driven, yet the community is powerless and has no real stake in developing the product. They&#39;re given padded rubber rooms to bounce around in harmlessly. That&#39;s not a good way to build community.</p></li>
<li><p>Google needs a lot more evangelists out there interacting with the community and bringing messages back and forth to the mothership. This is something that Microsoft does extraordinarily well, but Google does not seem to &quot;get it&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/new-question-asker-features/">some key changes</a> to (hopefully) increase engagement between question asker and answerers.

<li><p>The default votes answer sort order had a flaw: the sub-order was relevant! We now use random as the sub-order to the votes sort, to minimize any effect of the sub-order.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss lessons from a year of building Stack Overflow, the mysteries of COBOL, some YSlow website optimizations, and magic numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/11030/podcast-64-discussion-ideas-unofficial">What have we learned in a year of building Stack Overflow?</a> If someone wanted to design a system like Stack overflow, I&#39;d give them these two pieces of advice. First, never have any unbounded behavior in your website. Anywhere. Bounding, velocity and rate limiting, should be pervasive throughout your design from day one. Second, provide an outlet for meta discussion from day one. Unless you provide a teacher&#39;s lounge, or afterschool activities for the students, you haven&#39;t completed the experience.  </p></li>
<li><p>In our experience, the best way to manage online behavior is to make the positive behaviors fun and rewarding. If you do this right, the bad and negative behaviors fall by the wayside. (Although you also, regrettably, will still need tools for dealing with rare but aberrant behavior.)  </p></li>
<li><p>Neither Joel or I have ever met a COBOL programmer. That&#39;s why we&#39;re skeptical of these <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001294.html">dramatic claims that the world is overrun with invisible COBOL code</a>. There are, surprisingly, some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/cobol">good COBOL questions</a> on Stack Overflow, but it&#39;s a tiny fraction.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss lessons from a year of building Stack Overflow, the mysteries of COBOL, some YSlow website optimizations, and magic numbers.


What have we learned in a year of building Stack Overflow? If someone wanted to design a system like Stack overflow, I'd give them these two pieces of advice. First, never have any unbounded behavior in your website. Anywhere. Bounding, velocity and rate limiting, should be pervasive throughout your design from day one. Second, provide an outlet for meta discussion from day one. Unless you provide a teacher's lounge, or afterschool activities for the students, you haven't completed the experience.  
In our experience, the best way to manage online behavior is to make the positive behaviors fun and rewarding. If you do this right, the bad and negative behaviors fall by the wayside. (Although you also, regrettably, will still need tools for dealing with rare but aberrant behavior.)  
Neither Joel or I have ever met a COBOL programmer. That's why we're skeptical of these dramatic claims that the world is overrun with invisible COBOL code. There are, surprisingly, some good COBOL questions on Stack Overflow, but it's a tiny fraction.
How much COBOL code can you fit in the 1 megabyte (at most!) memory that these 60's and 70's era servers had? Or the tiny hard drives?
Is what happened to COBOL programmers eventually what happens to all programmers? Take SQL as an example. If you have 256 gigabytes of main memory -- not very expensive already, and getting cheaper every day -- is all that SQL and disk stuff still relevant?
We recently spent some time improving performance on Stack Overflow, and as always we've learned that whatever we think is slow, is not, and the part that is slow is in a totally unexpected area of our code. Never assume you know where a performance problem is, because I can almost guarantee you're wrong. Profile it and look at the data!
We've seen huge benefits, more than anticipated, by moving our static web content to a rate, cookieless domain. (We registered sstatic.net for this purpose, which explains the rationale.) This is one of the key recommendations from tools like YSlow and Google Page Speed. It's a surprisingly effective form of poor man's web farm scaling.
A brief digression into the "why does anyone still use IE6" argument. Here's Microsoft's official position, as crazy as it may seem.
We may be at the end of the road for the low hanging fruit of website performance optimizations. Of course we can always buy faster hardware. But that doesn't fix the speed of light problem. Given our large international audience, I sort of wish we could have multiple server farms in different geographic locations, but that may be quite a long way off.
Computer "magic number" number bugs are kind of fun; you may remember a very public Excel bug in this vein. Joel once got a credit card with an expiration date set in 2049, which is technically valid, but it barely worked anywhere.


Our favorite questions this week:


Is 23,148,855,308,184,500 a magic number, or sheer chance? A fascinating tale of programmer number forensics.
How to learn Cobol. OK, but first of all, why in the world would you want to do this?

<li><p>If you have feedback for <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> (still scheduled for beta by September 1st), please leave it on meta.stackoverflow.com <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stackexchange">under the Stack Exchange tag</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker list for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> is coming soon, it&#39;s looking really impressive so far. For example, both John Resig (of jQuery fame) and Miguel De Icaza (of Mono fame) will be at the Boston leg, and there are still seats available! There&#39;s also a rumor that Jeff Atwood, whoever that guy is, may show up in London.</p></li>
<li><p>We are forming a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/">League of Justice on the web</a>. The first new hero in our league is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/howtogeek-and-stack-overflow/">How-To Geek</a>, of the most excellent <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/">How-To Geek website</a>. It&#39;s the editorially cultivated content yin to our user-generated yang.</p></li>
<li><p>On the crushing disappointment of Google AdSense on Stack Overflow. The theory of AdSense, matching topical ads to the content on the page, is fantastic. The reality of the type of ads we actually saw on Stack Overflow is a terrible disappointment. They were barely relevant, and often quite ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>Our hand-selected ads, targetted to our audience, perform <em>50 times</em> better than AdSense. We believe that if Google could somehow tag a site with a specific audience topic (such as, say, &quot;programmers&quot;) it would do much better.</p></li>
<li><p>If a site like Stack Overflow, which does almost a million pageviews a day, can&#39;t make enough to cover even one person at half time using Google AdSense, how does <em>anyone</em> make a living with AdSense? Does it even work?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel says the only people making decent money with AdSense are scammers who specifically build websites to do nothing except target high pay-per-click keywords. I am not sure this is what Google had in mind. It is a stunning indictment of &quot;the power of the algorithm&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Our ad partner is Alex from <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a>, and we take <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000893.html">responsible advertising</a> seriously. The right kind of advertising, the relevant, interesting, thoughtful kind is win-win. And <em>always</em> in moderation. We are willing to leave money on the table to have the right kind of ads that we like editorially.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel has a great discussion about the difference in skillset between a good tester and a good programmer. &quot;There&#39;s something about the nature of the work that&#39;s different enough that a lot of good developers are bored by testing, and a lot of testers are too detail-oriented to get anything done as a developer.&quot; Some programming skills are helpful, but they&#39;re different.</p></li>
<li><p>There is great risk in creating standards in advance -- how do you know if you&#39;re solving a problem people care about, or even the right problem in the first place? Also, the disconnect between the theory and practice can be rather painful.</p></li>
<li><p>Who can we blame for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer">codified misspelling of &quot;referer&quot;</a>? I would like to have some words with this person.</p></li>
<li><p>We frequently use Stack Overflow to build Stack Overflow. It&#39;s almost a recursive endeavor. If you browse the questions the team asks on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=oldest">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href="http://serverfault.com/users?tab=oldest">Server Fault</a>, many of them are directly related to development and deployment issues on the sites themselves!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite questions this week are both from <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a>, which for now is still in semi-private beta. If you need the password it is &quot;ewok.adventure&quot; without the quotes.</p>

Three out of four of my Vista machines upgraded to Windows 7 fine. That fourth one, though ... I meticulously documented all the steps I took to troubleshoot it, so maybe my failure will be helpful to someone else in time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Adam</strong>: &quot;The Fog Creek way of hiring programmers has been well documented. What about hiring testers, and how they fit into your view of how software should be built?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kevin</strong>: &quot;What do you see as the role of standards committees in the development community?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>George</strong>: &quot;You talked about open sourcing Stack Overflow. Why not just write a book about it?&quot;</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss the Mythical Man Month problem, keeping communication in check, Windows 7, and web scaling.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel is fielding his largest team ever at Fog Creek -- 9 programmers, 2 testers, and 2 program managers. They only have 10 usable weeks in the summer to build a product with their interns, so they have to parallelize their development.</p></li>
<li><p>Contrary to popular myth, it is possible for a large team to be effective, if you mitigate<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law"> the Mythical Man Month problem</a>, which is really only about adding people to a late project and bringing them up to speed.  </p></li>
<li><p>How do you deal with an excess of communication (the explosion of paths) on larger teams? First, with program managers. That&#39;s what they are there to address, by becoming the conduit for communication. Second, constantly try to reduce the number of meetings and people in meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of communication excess, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001191.html">is email = efail</a>? This is also why I believe in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000854.html">maximizing the value of your keystrokes</a>, and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000840.html">the value of public communication</a>. If you must email someone, keep it extremely short, a paragraph at most, with a direct question and call to action that is obvious and clear.</p></li>
<li><p>One thought experiment: what would happen if all your email became Twitter messages? Or, as Joel proposes, is online communication itself a failed paradigm? At the very least, know the limitations of the communication medium you&#39;re using, and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001064.html">escalate as necessary</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some classes of plugins that can complement a product without competing with it: plugins that make the UI complex or dangerous, plugins that require a subscription fee, plugins that compete with the core business model of the product, and plugins that connect to a different commercial product.</p></li>
<li><p>Products that have a vibrant plugin ecosystem and API are almost by definition successful products. It also creates a sort of weird ambient lock-in around the ecosystem, as in Lotus 1-2-3 macros, or Firefox users who won&#39;t switch browsers due to their favorite plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of Windows 7, which has much more &quot;curb appeal&quot; than Vista. Joel was not a fan of Vista; I was. And Windows 7 is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001290.html">the best Vista service pack ever</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow almost reached a million pageviews per day last week, and we&#39;re consistently doing around 120 requests/sec, or 7200 requests/minute. We&#39;re starting to hit peaks of about 80% CPU usage on our single web server, so we may have to add a second webserver to the SO farm soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.ln.go.cn/resin-doc/config/sessions.xtp">sticky sessions</a>, we were surprised to find that there are those rare few users whose IP addresses will change radically from request to request.</p></li>
<li><p>We are a Microsoft stack so we&#39;re looking at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/cc655792.aspx">Velocity</a> to share state across multiple webservers. It&#39;s a clone of <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Scaling problems are easy to solve. Just <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">throw money at them</a>, like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1819-basecamp-now-with-more-vroom">37signals recently did</a>. The &quot;getting people to give a crap about your application&quot; problem <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html">does not respond to money in the same way</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We run a number of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/DownLoads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;displaylang=en">LogParser</a> queries on our webserver logs to identify statistically anomalous things that are happening on our website -- what sorts of queries do you run on <em>your</em> web logs to show unusual activity? One of the weirder spiders that&#39;s hitting us a lot is <a href="http://omgili.com/">Omgili</a>, a sort of forum search tool.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite question this week is from Server Fault:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/45516/recommended-logparser-queries-for-iis-monitoring">Recommended LogParser queries for IIS monitoring?</a> This is an example of putting the sort of information out into the world that we&#39;d like to see exist -- as well as documenting and sharing our own experience in hosting what is now a fairly large public website.<br></li>

How do you deal with an excess of communication (the explosion of paths) on larger teams? First, with program managers. That's what they are there to address, by becoming the conduit for communication. Second, constantly try to reduce the number of meetings and people in meetings.
Speaking of communication excess, is email = efail? This is also why I believe in maximizing the value of your keystrokes, and the value of public communication. If you must email someone, keep it extremely short, a paragraph at most, with a direct question and call to action that is obvious and clear.
One thought experiment: what would happen if all your email became Twitter messages? Or, as Joel proposes, is online communication itself a failed paradigm? At the very least, know the limitations of the communication medium you're using, and escalate as necessary.

Stack Overflow almost reached a million pageviews per day last week, and we're consistently doing around 120 requests/sec, or 7200 requests/minute. We're starting to hit peaks of about 80% CPU usage on our single web server, so we may have to add a second webserver to the SO farm soon.
Speaking of sticky sessions, we were surprised to find that there are those rare few users whose IP addresses will change radically from request to request.
We are a Microsoft stack so we're looking at Velocity to share state across multiple webservers. It's a clone of memcached.
Scaling problems are easy to solve. Just throw money at them, like 37signals recently did. The "getting people to give a crap about your application" problem does not respond to money in the same way.
We run a number of LogParser queries on our webserver logs to identify statistically anomalous things that are happening on our website -- what sorts of queries do you run on your web logs to show unusual activity? One of the weirder spiders that's hitting us a lot is Omgili, a sort of forum search tool.


Our favorite question this week is from Server Fault:


Recommended LogParser queries for IIS monitoring? This is an example of putting the sort of information out into the world that we'd like to see exist -- as well as documenting and sharing our own experience in hosting what is now a fairly large public website.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss software updates, the power of APIs and plugins, and leading by example.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A brief discussion of how software should be updated, using Firefox and Apple&#39;s Software Updater as examples. In a perfect world, you wouldn&#39;t need to care about software updates because you&#39;d always be on the latest version. A smart and silent update mechanism should be architected into your app from day one.  </p></li>
<li><p>Web apps largely get a pass on the &quot;latest version&quot; problem, but even here, you could update smart by having multiple web servers behind a load balancer, and rotating some servers out of service to update, then back in with the latest version.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of software updates, <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/WhatsNew.html">Fog Bugz 7 has shipped</a>. It&#39;s the first new version in two years, with a brand new, extensive plugin API.   </p></li>
<li><p>Joel wonders if having a robust plugin model can replace the need to constantly ship new major versions of your software with new features. I question whether Fog Creek <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/plugins/">got their plugin API</a> right the first time, but if done right, this is totally plausible.</p></li>
<li><p>I view plugins as free product design and highly valuable product feedback -- so you should fold the top 5 plugins / add-ons into your product every year or so. But how do you do this without crushing your partners in the ecosystem? There are plenty of examples of popular iPhone paid apps being obsoleted by, say, iPhone OS 3.0. Joel argues that plugins should go vertical, and stay out of the path of that oncoming steamroller.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that we have four sites in the er.. trilogy.. it is finally possible to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/">associate your accounts</a> between the sites, and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/migrate-questions-between-websites/">migrate questions fairly painlessly</a> from site to site.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes we belatedly realize that we got something wrong. We&#39;re now thinking that our current +10 upvote, -2 downvote formula nerfs downvotes into oblivion, and lets certain classes of users who tend to ask a lot of low-quality &quot;do my work for me&quot; questions gain a substantial amount of reputation over time. We are pondering making an adjustment here, which is <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/7322/should-the-weight-of-downvotes-be-increased">under discussion at meta.stackoverflow.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe we should be weighting question votes differently, since users who continue to repeatedly ask dozens of low quality questions are <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/1326/please-charge-rep-for-questions-after-threshold">still an ongoing concern.</a> As we get more and more questions in the system, the voting system needs to help us discriminate good questions from poor ones, so we want to encourage question votes.  </p></li>
<li><p>There is now officially a full time Fog Creek developer working on <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> -- welcome Aaron Maenpaa to the team! On a related note, one advantage of open source tooling is that you don&#39;t have to have painful discussions about licensing expenses and whether the tool is worth using as your team grows.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">R language</a> enthusiasts are taking a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/stack-overflow-flash-mobs/">clever and effective approach</a> to get more R content on Stack Overflow -- we think this is a great way to build a community that is completely in tune with the spirit of the site.</p></li>
<li><p>In the post <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000933.html">Leading by Example</a>, I proposed that one of the best ways (maybe the only way?) to lead junior programmers is to do the things you wish they&#39;d do, and let them observe your success. Those that can be led, will follow to some degree, and the rest are a lost cause.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s broaden the terms. Forget programmers, how do you get pizza guys or car wash guys to get excited about what they do? Joel says you can&#39;t. I say there has to be some kind of hippie commune shared ownership business arrangement. At the very least, you can become interested in efficiency, since that might mean you could leave earlier, make more money, or work less.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>J.D. Long</strong>: &quot;The R language is attempting to move away from isolated mailing list and adopt Stack Overflow as a resource. What&#39;s a good way to do this?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sergei</strong>: &quot;I am a programmer in a small IT company. I often see my junior teammates program things that are not optimal. I try to help them, but they&#39;ve complained to my manager. What should I do about this?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite site questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/42678/dns-failing-to-propagate-worldwide">DNS failing to propagate worldwide</a>. I used this as an example of asking a question the right way, in that you put some effort into the question -- research the problem first and provide all the information necessary for people to help you.</li>
</ul>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the podcast, Joel and Jeff sit down with Miguel de Icaza of the Mono project to discuss Mono, Silverlight / Moonlight, and the pros and cons of open sourcing your code.


Miguel is one of the lead developers on the Mono project, which is an ongoing effort to bring the .NET framework to Linux and other non-Microsoft platforms.
Miguel characterizes Silverlight (known as Moonlight on Mono) as "the good parts" of WPF. It's a newer way to build a cross-platform GUI app, an alternative to GTK and Windows Forms.
A brief discussion of the implications of cross-platform GUIs, which lack that native flair. Do you have the manpower to maintain three distinct versions of your GUI application -- one for Mac, one for Windows, and one for *nixes? Do only programmers notice the subtle differences? 
Revisiting Fitt's Law, and applications and operating systems that don't make good use of it. Certain areas of the screen, mostly the top and bottom and to a lesser extent the sides, are infinitely large, and should be used prominently in the UI to leverage Fitt's Law.
Mono runs on the iPhone, through the Unity game engine! This was challenging for the Mono team to develop, because interpreters and runtimes are explicitly disallowed in terms of the iPhone SDK. Mono had to be converted from a JIT to a static compiler.
Per Miguel, programmers wanted Mono because Objective-C is fairly primitive in memory management and requires a lot of repetition and boilerplate. With Mono "this is all taken care for you", as a higher level language.
Due to concerns within the free software community, Microsoft made a legally binding promise that it will not enforce patents against Mono -- for the core framework.
It turns out that the Microsoft Office 2010 web component, which is free for consumers, is 100% JavaScript + HTML. If Silverlight wasn't required to pull off Office-in-the-browser by Microsoft itself, is Silverlight really necessary in the bigger scheme of things?
Miguel divides the world into PutPixel Programmers and printf programmers. Which type are you?
Some big game projects that use Mono for scripting: Second Life, and The Sims 3. Also, a very large social networking site I can't mention by name was recently ported to Mono.
One of my long term 5 year goals is for the Stack Overflow discussion engine to become a go-to choice for public internet discussion, on par with phpBB and its kin.
Miguel offers his insight into the controversial discussion of whether open sourcing Stack Overflow would destroy our business model.
We actually have contributed one open-source component of Stack Overflow back to the community -- the Javascript WMD editor. Also, we provide all of our question and answer content back to the community licensed as cc-wiki.
Our Stack Exchange hosted solution will offer free versions for non-profit organizations, and we're also looking at provided an ad-subsidized version of it as well.
Miguel de Icaza is also a Stack Overflow user -- with 22 answers and 3,484 reputation.
Check out the Mono Migration Analyzer, which will tell you how easily you can (or can't) port your .NET project to Mono and run it on other platforms. Please do, because feedback from this tool is used to prioritize future Mono development!
Miguel committed to speaking at the Boston Stack Overflow DevDays and presenting some of the same Mono goodness he talked about here.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 60th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss the value (or lack thereof) of meta-discussion, how much &quot;big iron&quot; popular websites need, and whether code forking is sometimes inevitable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A discussion of our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/">newly launched outlet for meta-discussion</a> at <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">meta.stackoverflow.com</a>. We view this as a pressure release valve. Why is meta-discussion necessary? What purpose does it serve, and for who?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I are both <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000463.html">headphone enthusiasts</a>. It&#39;s also a key part of the programmer&#39;s toolkit for getting &quot;in the zone&quot;, so it&#39;s worth investing in this area. A quality set of headphones can deliver an audio experience equivalent to floor-standing speakers worth thousands of dollars!</p></li>
<li><p>After <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/">three</a> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/logo-contest-winner-for-serverfaultcom/">logo</a> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/superuser-com-logo-vote/">contests</a>, we are becoming experts in crowdsourcing design. There is a risk here when people don&#39;t know what criteria they&#39;re supposed to be judging on. Joel brings up the point of televisions which all have a &quot;store mode&quot; which maximizes brightness and contrast to the actual detriment of the overall image quality. And if you use a LCD at its out of box brightness (always the maximum) <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000965.html">you&#39;re going to go blind</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>We took the plunge and upgraded our database server to its maximum of 48 GB of memory. This is mostly a cheap form of insurance against future growth. We may also end up taking advantage of SQL Server&#39;s <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/11/SQL-Server-Compression">database compression</a>. The old memory will be eventually used in a second database server we anticipate needing by the end of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>I was spurred on to do this after reading about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001279.html">the massive 512 GB monster server</a> that Plenty of Fish bought. It&#39;s interesting how the cost of &quot;free&quot;, at that scale (they&#39;re a top 20 website in the US and Canada), is no longer cheap. Joel points to a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell">scathing New Yorker review by Malcolm Gladwell of Chris Anderson&#39;s book Free</a>, which covers similar topics.</p></li>
<li><p>As Joel notes, paying $100,000 for a server <em>could</em> be more effective than spending $100,000 for a year&#39;s worth of programmer time to convert your database from single and monolithic (the traditional, classic SQL / Oracle model) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_%28database_architecture%29">sharded</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable">BigTable</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter, for example, has moved to an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/06/Twitter-Architecture">almost all in-memory database architecture</a>. The downside is that it is literally impossible for me to get to any of my Twitter messages older than the middle of 2008. Still a fan of twitter, though; it&#39;s actually useful. Consider the story of an indie musician <a href="http://mikeking.berkleemusicblogs.com/2009/06/23/how-an-indie-musician-can-make-19000-in-10-hours-using-twitter/">who made $19,000 in 10 hours on Twitter</a>, while netting exactly $0 from 30,000 traditional record sales.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ethics and legality of using code from one job on a different job? If you get a job as a programmer and you never signed anything, then you own all the code you wrote. Most employers sign a <a href="http://www.nolo.com/definition.cfm/Term/AE4ACD77-12AC-4705-B870E4551730F72C/alpha/W/">Work for Hire agreement</a> which means they own all the code you write while on the job. </p></li>
<li><p>Should Stack Overflow be <em>eventually</em> open-sourced? Joel is concerned that open sourcing the code would interfere with the hosted product <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> that Fog Creek is building out right now. I don&#39;t see a conflict between these two audiences; one has infinite time and no money, and the other wants a turnkey, &quot;it just works&quot; solution for a reasonable price.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel thinks that hosts deploying open source software crash the business model down to the cost of the hosting itself. I wonder how companies like <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> (of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> fame) continue to survive if that is the case. And eventually, won&#39;t someone create an open source clone of what you&#39;re doing anyway? Why not beat them to the punch and take control of the situation, by open sourcing the real thing yourself?</p></li>
<li><p>I continue to have deep skepticism that <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">the hosted Fog Creek version of Stack Overflow</a> cannot avoid a serious fork with our code. The audience of the ad-supported general internet, versus the audience of paying customers building topic-specific &#39;stacks, is very different. Can version control tools save you when you&#39;re building the &quot;same&quot; products for such different audiences?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<li><strong>Lloyd</strong>: &quot;I am leaving a business and working for a competitor in a different business. I want to take the codebase I&#39;ve worked on for the last few years with me -- to use as a reference point for future products. What advice can you give?&quot;</li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 60th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss the value (or lack thereof) of meta-discussion, how much "big iron" popular websites need, and whether code forking is sometimes inevitable.


A discussion of our newly launched outlet for meta-discussion at meta.stackoverflow.com. We view this as a pressure release valve. Why is meta-discussion necessary? What purpose does it serve, and for who?
Joel and I are both headphone enthusiasts. It's also a key part of the programmer's toolkit for getting "in the zone", so it's worth investing in this area. A quality set of headphones can deliver an audio experience equivalent to floor-standing speakers worth thousands of dollars!
After three logo contests, we are becoming experts in crowdsourcing design. There is a risk here when people don't know what criteria they're supposed to be judging on. Joel brings up the point of televisions which all have a "store mode" which maximizes brightness and contrast to the actual detriment of the overall image quality. And if you use a LCD at its out of box brightness (always the maximum) you're going to go blind!
We took the plunge and upgraded our database server to its maximum of 48 GB of memory. This is mostly a cheap form of insurance against future growth. We may also end up taking advantage of SQL Server's database compression. The old memory will be eventually used in a second database server we anticipate needing by the end of the year.
I was spurred on to do this after reading about the massive 512 GB monster server that Plenty of Fish bought. It's interesting how the cost of "free", at that scale (they're a top 20 website in the US and Canada), is no longer cheap. Joel points to a scathing New Yorker review by Malcolm Gladwell of Chris Anderson's book Free, which covers similar topics.
As Joel notes, paying $100,000 for a server could be more effective than spending $100,000 for a year's worth of programmer time to convert your database from single and monolithic (the traditional, classic SQL / Oracle model) to sharded (Hadoop and BigTable).
Twitter, for example, has moved to an almost all in-memory database architecture. The downside is that it is literally impossible for me to get to any of my Twitter messages older than the middle of 2008. Still a fan of twitter, though; it's actually useful. Consider the story of an indie musician who made $19,000 in 10 hours on Twitter, while netting exactly $0 from 30,000 traditional record sales.
What are the ethics and legality of using code from one job on a different job? If you get a job as a programmer and you never signed anything, then you own all the code you wrote. Most employers sign a Work for Hire agreement which means they own all the code you write while on the job.

Jeff sit down with <a href="http://damienkatz.net/">Damien Katz</a> (of CouchDB) to discuss non-conventional databases, non-conventional programming languages, and taking on non-conventional programming projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stop, do not pass go, do not collect $200: <strong>watch Damien Katz&#39; outstanding Rubyfringe presentation, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/katz-couchdb-and-me">CouchDB and Me</a></strong>. It is a hugely inspirational presentation for any working programmer. I can&#39;t recommend it enough. Go watch it now!</p></li>
<li><p>We have forgiven Damien Katz for working on Lotus Notes. Mostly. To his credit, he did write some very cool code, as documented in <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2005/01/formula-engine-rewrite.html">his famous formula engine rewrite</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can think of <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Damien Katz&#39; CouchDB project</a> as the distilled &quot;good stuff&quot; from Lotus Notes. Wait! Why are you running away? Come back! It&#39;s not that bad! We swear!  </p></li>
<li><p>Damien used Erlang to build CouchDB, largely because <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2006/06/one_reason_i_ch.html">it makes error recovery and multiprocessing so much easier</a>. Or as Damien says &quot;what happens when everything goes to s**t&quot;. In other words, networking fails, or you don&#39;t have enough memory to complete the operation. This is stuff that is very tricky in C++, but almost trivial in Erlang.</p></li>
<li><p>CouchDB took off when the JSON and JavaScript bindings were produced -- and were <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2007/09/couchdb_strikes.html">a big hit</a>. This probably says something about trying to popularize your open source project: is it accessible to the average programmer?</p></li>
<li><p>On Damien&#39;s journey as a software developer: &quot;eventually you get tired of working on stuff for other people.&quot;   </p></li>
<li><p>The negotiations with IBM included the synonyms &quot;douchebags&quot; and &quot;vapid bureaucrats&quot;. They seemed to appreciate his honesty (at least for the set of bad eggs he&#39;s referring to), and Damien is a guy who has spent some time in the bowels of IBM and knows what he is getting into.  </p></li>
<li><p>I liked that Damien, when he reached analysis paralysis in the middle of his project, turned to the soothing, calming midwestern voice of Steve McConnell -- and the classic (and my favorite) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670/codinghorror-20">Code Complete 2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>While building up two new 1U servers for superuser.com, powering on the server with the cover off would trigger the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_reflex">Moro reflex</a> in our <a href="https://twitter.com/rockhardawesome">3 month old baby</a>... two rooms over! That&#39;s how loud they are. REALLY loud. I was happy to have UPS take those out of my house.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn&#39;t appreciate how much happier I would be with community moderation -- I am unburdened from being the judge, jury, and executioner of the occasional serious misbehavior. It&#39;s a group discussion now -- <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-new-community-moderators/">thanks to our awesome community moderators</a>, we can reach a concensus together!</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean for an open-source project to be version 1? Version 0.1? Version 0.5? When is it good enough to use? Should you look at commit activity; is the project alive? Or should you look at how many people are actually <em>using</em> the software, regardless of version number or commit activity?</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re a developer, and wondering what specific problem CouchDB could solve for you, Damien says: &quot;would the data you have typically be stored in a document in real life?&quot; The classic example is a contacts database. Do you have a phobia of storing large blobs in a database?</p></li>
<li><p>I think most hardware-oriented software developers have gone through this thought process at least once: &quot;Hmm. I have gobs and gobs of system memory. Do I really <em>need</em> a swapfile on disk any more?&quot; Don&#39;t try to outsmart the operating system designers, unless you&#39;re an operating system designer. And that goes triple for programmers who think they are language designers!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Maayan</strong>: &quot;What is your stance about using open source software in production code, when the open source project in question is working, but is either below 1.0 or is not actively maintained?&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/299723/can-i-do-transactions-and-locks-in-couchdb">Can I do transactions and locks in CouchDB?</a> A brief discussion of how this works in CouchDB versus a typical SQL database.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/23621/any-benefit-or-detriment-from-removing-a-pagefile-on-an-8gb-ram-machine">Any benefit or detriment from removing a pagefile on an 8GB RAM machine?</a> short answer: no.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 58th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss HTML encoding, designing &quot;safe by default&quot;, whether a question can be too simple, and the art of beta testing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel wonders if doing his Visual Studio development in a virtual machine is a viable solution. I say in this era of cheap 8 GB RAM and quad core CPUs, why not?</p></li>
<li><p>As always, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/it-stack-overflow-update-naming-is-hard/">Naming Is Hard</a>. We&#39;re struggling with naming the hosted Stack Overflow that Fog Creek is working on. Joel likes the name &quot;Stack Exchange&quot;. It&#39;s not bad, but we wonder if anyone listening has a better idea?</p></li>
<li><p>I admit, finally, that Joel was right about something. Don&#39;t HTML encode data that&#39;s stored in your database! Take the <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2007/12/18/5-signs-your-aspnet-application-may-be-vulnerable-to-html-injection">good advice of Damien Guard</a> and Joel Spolsky! You can choose to store both representations, but don&#39;t store just the HTML; go with the raw data at the highest level of precision.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief political rant about the evil of view engines that fail to HTML encode by default. The problem with this design choice is that it is not &quot;safe by default&quot;, which is <strong>always</strong> the wrong choice for a framework or API. Forget to encode some bit of user-entered data in <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2007/12/10/how-dangerous-is-html-injection"><em>one single stinking place</em> in your web app</a>, and you will be totally owned with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a>. Believe it. I know because it&#39;s happened to us. Multiple times!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel maintains that, with a strongly-typed language and the right framework, it&#39;s possible (in theory) to completely eliminate XSS -- this would require using a specific data type, a type that is your only way to send data to the browser. That data type would be validated at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>We continue to ramp up on our computer enthusiast site, <a href="http://superuser.com/">superuser.com</a> -- we just launched a <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/details">logo design contest at crowdspring</a>. This will be as close as we ever get to an &quot;anything goes&quot; website, and I&#39;m excited to see what happens.</p></li>
<li><p>I maintain your online behavior shouldn&#39;t be all that different than your general public behavior. I say &quot;don&#39;t post anything you wouldn&#39;t want your mom to read.&quot; Joel cites the Wall Street rule: &quot;don&#39;t ever write anything you wouldn&#39;t want published on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.&quot; Also, systems where people are able to behave as if nobody is watching are fundamentally broken systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel says that the only bad simple question is a <em>duplicate</em> simple question. I say simple questions are OK as long as they&#39;re actually interesting (in some way) for other users to consider and answer. To prove his point, Joel actually asks the question on Stack Overflow: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo">How do I move the turtle in LOGO</a>? Do <em>you</em> think this question adds value?</p></li>
<li><p>Some ruminations about the challenge of asking questions when you are a total beginner and not even sure what you should be asking. Perhaps the best solution there is &quot;screenshots&quot;, or in code parlance: just shut up and show us the code!</p></li>
<li><p>Beta testing is an art, and perhaps the first beta test barrier is if people can actually understand whatever the heck it is you&#39;re trying to do. There&#39;s often a disconnect between what beta users say (particularly gung-ho early adopters who love betas) and what typical users do. Unfortunately at the early beta, you lack the one thing you&#39;d benefit from most: lots of usage data!</p></li>
<li><p>The absurdity of the term &quot;Content Management System&quot;. It&#39;s for, y&#39;know, managing.. content. What does this even mean? Trying to be everything to everyone means you solve nobody&#39;s problem particularly well. Maybe this is why Fog Creek&#39;s hosted FogBugz is not attempting to expand thematically beyond their core business: software bug tracking.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/24933/questionable-timeservers-in-pool-ntp-org">random NTP server that Joel ran into</a>? They&#39;re back -- and they made a slightly .. uh.. disturbing .. theme song for us! Thanks! We think!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Joseph</strong>: &quot;Now that you have the jobs connection up and running, how do you think that will affect the questions and answers on the site -- that some future employer might see what they&#39;re doing?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frank</strong>: &quot;What are your thoughts on getting beta testers (and getting good beta results) when you don&#39;t necessarily have a super high profile project?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

As always, Naming Is Hard. We're struggling with naming the hosted Stack Overflow that Fog Creek is working on. Joel likes the name "Stack Exchange". It's not bad, but we wonder if anyone listening has a better idea?
I admit, finally, that Joel was right about something. Don't HTML encode data that's stored in your database! Take the good advice of Damien Guard and Joel Spolsky! You can choose to store both representations, but don't store just the HTML; go with the raw data at the highest level of precision.
A brief political rant about the evil of view engines that fail to HTML encode by default. The problem with this design choice is that it is not "safe by default", which is always the wrong choice for a framework or API. Forget to encode some bit of user-entered data in one single stinking place in your web app, and you will be totally owned with XSS. Believe it. I know because it's happened to us. Multiple times!
Joel maintains that, with a strongly-typed language and the right framework, it's possible (in theory) to completely eliminate XSS -- this would require using a specific data type, a type that is your only way to send data to the browser. That data type would be validated at compile time.
We continue to ramp up on our computer enthusiast site, superuser.com -- we just launched a logo design contest at crowdspring. This will be as close as we ever get to an "anything goes" website, and I'm excited to see what happens.
I maintain your online behavior shouldn't be all that different than your general public behavior. I say "don't post anything you wouldn't want your mom to read." Joel cites the Wall Street rule: "don't ever write anything you wouldn't want published on the front page of the Wall Street Journal." Also, systems where people are able to behave as if nobody is watching are fundamentally broken systems.
Joel says that the only bad simple question is a duplicate simple question. I say simple questions are OK as long as they're actually interesting (in some way) for other users to consider and answer. To prove his point, Joel actually asks the question on Stack Overflow: How do I move the turtle in LOGO? Do you think this question adds value?
Some ruminations about the challenge of asking questions when you are a total beginner and not even sure what you should be asking. Perhaps the best solution there is "screenshots", or in code parlance: just shut up and show us the code!
Beta testing is an art, and perhaps the first beta test barrier is if people can actually understand whatever the heck it is you're trying to do. There's often a disconnect between what beta users say (particularly gung-ho early adopters who love betas) and what typical users do. Unfortunately at the early beta, you lack the one thing you'd benefit from most: lots of usage data!
The absurdity of the term "Content Management System". It's for, y'know, managing.. content. What does this even mean? Trying to be everything to everyone means you solve nobody's problem particularly well. Maybe this is why Fog Creek's hosted FogBugz is not attempting to expand thematically beyond their core business: software bug tracking.
Remember that random NTP server that Joel ran into? They're back -- and they made a slightly .. uh.. disturbing .. theme song for us! Thanks! We think!


We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:


Joseph: "Now that you have the jobs connection up and running, how do you think that will affect the questions and answers on the site -- that some future employer might see what they're doing?"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 57th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss the relationship between speed and skill, iPhone development, and the value of programming fundamentals.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel comments on the surprising correlation between how fast you can solve a simple problem, and your overall skill level as a programmer. This is why giving even a very experienced programmer a simple problem can still work. If you can&#39;t truly master the fundamentals, it&#39;s hard to work at higher levels of abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p>We agree with Paul Graham: in general, there tends to be a correlation between the length of a response and its quality. We&#39;ve also observed this pattern on Stack Overflow. It isn&#39;t <em>always</em> true (TL;DR), but it&#39;s a verifiable pattern. Either be the first and quickest, or be the best and most comprehensive!</p></li>
<li><p>Due to high demand, five new cities were added to the <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a>: Boston, Austin, Los Angeles, Cambridge (UK), and Amsterdam.</p></li>
<li><p>I was quite impressed with the striking design Mike Kus put together for the Stack Overflow DevDays website. He <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/the-evolution-of-a-website-design/">breaks it down step by step</a> for us. Like most programmers, I&#39;m a terrible designer, but at least I know what&#39;s <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000152.html">good enough to steal!</a></p></li>
<li><p>As promised, we released a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">creative commons data dump</a> of all the Stack Overflow data including all questions and answers. We&#39;re excited to see what the community can do with this data; Brent Ozar put together a <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/blog/sql-server-tutorial/data-mining-the-stackoverflow-database/">data mining video</a> to get people started.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow has become a very popular destination for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/iphone">iPhone development</a>. This is completely accidental, but it is a valid reflection of the vibrant and growing iPhone development community. If you&#39;re an iPhone developer, check out the <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com">Mobile Orchard</a> website and <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/category/podcast/">podcast</a>, which even has a <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/best-of-stack-overflow-for-iphone-devs/">best of Stack Overflow for iPhone developers</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I are tremendously impressed with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">Apple&#39;s development push for the iPhone</a>, including the App Store. It is remarkably Microsoft-like, in a good way -- it&#39;s completely driven by <em>developers, developers, developers!</em> &quot;If you want to be a mobile developer, your #1 choice has to be Apple.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Some comments on the sad state of Windows Mobile (rumored <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/mobile.aspx">Silverlight reboot</a>), <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> (go HTML 5!) and the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/">Palm Pre</a> (is HTML/JavaScript/CSS a viable development platform)?</p></li>
<li><p>One downside of discussing questions on the podcast is that it leads to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>, and sometimes radically changes the state of the question.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Josh Hunt: &quot;The first answer to my question, the answer that got the highest number of votes, was not correct -- has Stack Overflow failed in the &#39;first answer is best&#39; aspect?&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve been taught algorithms in our high school using pseudocode. What do you think of this?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If I&#39;ve applied for a job at Fog Creek (or anywhere else) and didn&#39;t quite make it, what can I do to improve myself as a programmer and have a better chance next time?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://calacanis.com/">Jason Calacanis</a> regales us with his tales of being a BBS script kiddie on his IBM PC Jr. He later got fired from his job in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University">Fordham</a> computer lab for setting up a warez partition on one of the computers in the lab. Oh, and he installed a keylogger on his boss&#39;s computer, and sold pirated software on floppies, too. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Jason was one of the earliest internet reporters on the east coast with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis#Rising_Tide_Studios">Silicon Alley Reporter</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently the Q&amp;A format -- dubbed &quot;Knowledge Exchange&quot; -- was pioneered in Korea with <a href="http://www.naver.com/">Naver</a> and <a href="http://www.daum.net/">Daum</a>, which Yahoo Answers copied for the US. In Korea, the primary way to get information is through users exchanging knowledge, not search algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than translate the app, Facebook apparently let users volunteer to translate different parts of the Facebook UI itself. Jason&#39;s <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a> is not localized.</p></li>
<li><p>In Korea, the main knowledge exchange sites are all noindexed, so Google is a non-starter there. If all the newspapers in the US noindexed as a consortium, Google would be screwed.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason is a big fan of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges">the badge system on Stack Overflow</a>, which he plans to add to Mahalo. This of course is modelled on the Xbox 360 Achievements system; every badge in the system is there to encourage community building (and not inadvertently community destroying) behavior. It&#39;s a surprisingly fine line.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s big objection to Mahalo is that, like the now-defunct Google Answers, it turns an intrinsic motivation for asking and answering questions into an extrinsic motivation (hey, I can get paid real money for this!)</p></li>
<li><p>Jason maintains that money is not the primary motivator on Mahalo. He calls it a &quot;<a href="http://www.skeeball.com/about.htm">Skee-Ball</a> Economy&quot;, where you are playing skee-ball for fun, and getting lots of tickets to cash out and buy fun things. It&#39;s a &quot;token economy&quot;. You can&#39;t make a lot of money, but it (theoretically) adds a secondary driver to an already fun activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason equates the Stack Overflow community with an &quot;expert economy&quot;, akin to the open source software ecosystem. Jason mentioned that he has used <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">hadoop</a> mailing lists to identify people to hire and/or bring in to teach the other developers at Mahalo. My question is, why shouldn&#39;t Mahalo <em>also</em> be an expert economy?</p></li>
<li><p>Jason says &quot;I&#39;m not so much into creating the financial system to get something out of people, it&#39;s more that I like to take work that was previously undercompensated or not compensated and make it into a career. I&#39;m very proud of the fact that we [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis#Weblogs.2C_Inc.">WebLogs, Inc.</a>] were the company that made blogging into a career.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Jason famously <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/calacanis_offer.php">offered the top 25 users of Digg $1,000 a month to become community managers at Netscape</a>. And 23 of the 25 users took that offer. Joel says this is like paying for sex -- applying money at the one point where most people do not have a problem getting people to contribute to a community. Jason: &quot;I may have made a mistake&quot;, but traffic increased, and he maintains there was already a shadow economy around paid submissions to Digg.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason, who has a reporting background, ultimately wanted to add a layer of journalism and editorial control to the stories submitted to Digg. Even on &quot;anything goes&quot; vote driven sites like Digg, they do have one level of editorial control, in that stories can be &quot;in dispute.&quot;  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel asks Jason -- with your background in VC and funding, what would you do with Stack Overflow? Would you raise money? How, why, and for what? (Which reminds me: what&#39;s the difference between VC funding and a flaming bag of poop left on your doorstep? Trick question! There is no difference!)</p></li>
<li><p>We now offer an integrated job board -- if you&#39;re looking for gigs, or looking for a great programmer or sysadmin, check out <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/">jobs.stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href="http://jobs.serverfault.com/">jobs.serverfault.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of advertising strategies and philosophies. I&#39;m very skeptical of self-serve advertising after my experience with Google AdSense, which performs <em>abysmally</em> badly on Stack Overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Are community-driven sites like Mahalo and Stack Overflow turning users into <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2009/03/facebook-digital-sharecroppers.html">digital sharecroppers</a>? Is it an economic system where <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2008/tc20081228_809309.htm">people are working for praise</a>? Does splitting the revenue with the user, ala <a href="http://knol.google.com/k">Knol</a> and <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/">Google Answers</a>, really work? The track record for this approach is not good. And if you optimize for things that are popular, no matter what they are, then you end up with a site where every question is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon">the programming cartoon question</a>. I call this &quot;Mahalo&quot;.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the next 6-8 weeks, we&#39;ll be launching the third site in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">the Stack Overflow trilogy</a> -- <a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a>. This is a site for power users and computer enthusiasts.</p></li>
<li><p>Is writing software &quot;hard&quot;? That depends on your tolerance for frustration and what you happen to be building.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason, as a serial entrepreneur, points out that there is no downside or risk to starting a company and failing in the United States. If you have great ideas, don&#39;t just let them marinate in your brain forever -- get out there and start building them!</p></li>
<li><p>One of my favorite Calacanis posts is <a href="http://calacanis.com/2007/02/07/why-people-hate-seo-and-why-smo-is-bulls-t/">Why people hate SEO ... and why SMO is bullcrap</a>. 90% of SEO is simple rules for building clean HTML. The other 10% is that SEOs are really just life coaches who need to transform their clients into something awesome that people actually care about. What you really need to optimize for is <em>being awesome</em>. And that&#39;s a bit harder than pulling some SEO out of your magic bag of tricks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Brian McKay</strong>: &quot;I recently read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400082463/?tag=codinghorror-20">Dreaming in Code</a>. One of the concepts in the book is that software development is a very difficult profession -- that software and surgery are two of the most difficult things that a person can attempt. Do you agree with this?&quot;</li>

Jason Calacanis regales us with his tales of being a BBS script kiddie on his IBM PC Jr. He later got fired from his job in the Fordham computer lab for setting up a warez partition on one of the computers in the lab. Oh, and he installed a keylogger on his boss's computer, and sold pirated software on floppies, too. :)
Jason was one of the earliest internet reporters on the east coast with Silicon Alley Reporter.
Apparently the Q&A format -- dubbed "Knowledge Exchange" -- was pioneered in Korea with Naver and Daum, which Yahoo Answers copied for the US. In Korea, the primary way to get information is through users exchanging knowledge, not search algorithms.
Rather than translate the app, Facebook apparently let users volunteer to translate different parts of the Facebook UI itself. Jason's Mahalo is not localized.
In Korea, the main knowledge exchange sites are all noindexed, so Google is a non-starter there. If all the newspapers in the US noindexed as a consortium, Google would be screwed.
Jason is a big fan of the badge system on Stack Overflow, which he plans to add to Mahalo. This of course is modelled on the Xbox 360 Achievements system; every badge in the system is there to encourage community building (and not inadvertently community destroying) behavior. It's a surprisingly fine line.  
Joel's big objection to Mahalo is that, like the now-defunct Google Answers, it turns an intrinsic motivation for asking and answering questions into an extrinsic motivation (hey, I can get paid real money for this!)
Jason maintains that money is not the primary motivator on Mahalo. He calls it a "Skee-Ball Economy", where you are playing skee-ball for fun, and getting lots of tickets to cash out and buy fun things. It's a "token economy". You can't make a lot of money, but it (theoretically) adds a secondary driver to an already fun activity.
Jason equates the Stack Overflow community with an "expert economy", akin to the open source software ecosystem. Jason mentioned that he has used nginx and hadoop mailing lists to identify people to hire and/or bring in to teach the other developers at Mahalo. My question is, why shouldn't Mahalo also be an expert economy?
Jason says "I'm not so much into creating the financial system to get something out of people, it's more that I like to take work that was previously undercompensated or not compensated and make it into a career. I'm very proud of the fact that we [WebLogs, Inc.] were the company that made blogging into a career."
Jason famously offered the top 25 users of Digg $1,000 a month to become community managers at Netscape. And 23 of the 25 users took that offer. Joel says this is like paying for sex -- applying money at the one point where most people do not have a problem getting people to contribute to a community. Jason: "I may have made a mistake", but traffic increased, and he maintains there was already a shadow economy around paid submissions to Digg.
Jason, who has a reporting background, ultimately wanted to add a layer of journalism and editorial control to the stories submitted to Digg. Even on "anything goes" vote driven sites like Digg, they do have one level of editorial control, in that stories can be "in dispute."  
Joel asks Jason -- with your background in VC and funding, what would you do with Stack Overflow? Would you raise money? How, why, and for what? (Which reminds me: what's the difference between VC funding and a flaming bag of poop left on your doorstep? Trick question! There is no difference!)

<ul>
<li><p>Server Fault <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-launches/">has launched!</a> If you&#39;re a sysadmin or IT pro type, <a href="http://serverfault.com">please join us there</a>.   </p></li>
<li><p>You may have noticed that <a href="http://www.woot.com/">woot!</a> is the launch sponsor of Server Fault. These sorts of (hopefully) tasteful advertiser relationships underwrite continued development of the site -- and let us do cool things like bring on Geoff Dalgas as <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/">Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00003</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean to be successful as a writer online? Perhaps one metric of success is getting people you respect and admire to link to your writing in an organic, natural way (that is, without asking them to).</p></li>
<li><p>Steve Yegge indicated <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/05/programmers-view-of-universe-part-3.html">he may blog anonymously or not at all</a> in the future. We suspect that Steve&#39;s high profile as a notable software blogger makes it difficult for him at Google, which is a notoriously secretive company. Not <em>Apple</em> secretive, mind you, but close. We agree that as much as Steve writes, it&#39;s coming out of him one way or the other, but unfortunately it may be anonymous from this point on. </p></li>
<li><p>If we can render virtual 3D worlds at 60 frames per second, why haven&#39;t our software development IDEs evolved much beyond ASCII text for layout? How about <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6889812/Visual-Comments">visual comments?</a> And Lutz Roeder wonders about <a href="http://www.lutzroeder.com/paper/InteractiveSourceCode.ppt">Interactive Source Code</a> (ppt). Why not have diagrams in the code, or even better, dynamic visualization of the data structures in that code?  </p></li>
<li><p>My thoughts on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000195.html">what it takes to build a killer IDE</a>. I&#39;m still waiting, by the way.  </p></li>
<li><p>An analysis of what it takes to have a vibrant add-in ecosystem, while still folding in the most popular add-ins to the core of the product, where they rightfully belong. This is a fine line to walk, particularly for commercial software.</p></li>
<li><p>It really is amazing how many problems go away when your software is all open source. Except for the &quot;how do we pay our employees&quot; one.</p></li>
<li><p>How much feedback should job interview candidates get when the interview doesn&#39;t work out? Joel and I have an extended discussion. This is a lot trickier than it seems at first glance. At some level, perhaps you have to treat job interviews (particularly at extremely selective companies like Fog Creek) like romantic relationships -- sometimes there just isn&#39;t chemistry. Rather than over-analyze it, learn what you can, and move on to the next relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t ask what programming language beginning programmers should learn -- ask what type of programming do you want to train people to do! Do you want to teach theory, or skill?   </p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s example of the MIT curriculum of robot programming is a fantastic one: &quot;what they care about is not the actual language. It&#39;s not a matter of teaching you the Python, it&#39;s teaching you to be a programmer in an environment where everything is constantly falling down around you, nothing as works as documented, even if there were documentation, and there isn&#39;t, and if there was documentation, it was probably written by a technical writer who was afraid to go into the programmer&#39;s offices because the last time she went in she got her head bitten off.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>How to deal with headstrong know-it-all beginning programmers? Been there, done that. And by that I mean I was one, too. You have to fail. In fact, make them fail, if you can. As Joel says, they have to learn that &quot;no code that you write can ever possibly work.&quot; We know. Alternately, throw a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670/codinghorror-20">Code Complete</a> at them, if they&#39;re in a place where they can actually learn from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly one of the worst scenarios for beginning programmers is to be in a company where everyone is a beginning programmer. It does help to have some seasoned veterans in the mix, otherwise you&#39;re basically living out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399529209/?tag=codinghorror-20">Lord of the Flies</a> -- and if you don&#39;t know who Piggy is, then it&#39;s you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;I read on Steve Yegge&#39;s blog that he&#39;s <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/05/programmers-view-of-universe-part-3.html">not going to blog any more</a>. What are your thoughts on this?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Chris: &quot;Can you point to a particular article or time where you realized that your blog was going somewhere?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Ohad: &quot;Why can&#39;t rich comment be put in source code as comments? Why not use images, document snippets, and so forth?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/868301/how-can-i-teach-a-know-it-all-beginner-programmer">How can I teach a know-it-all beginner programmer?</a> Many of us start out this way, sadly, so put yourself in.. er.. your own shoes.<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332952/whats-up-with-o1"><br>
</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309160/what-programming-language-should-be-taught-in-computer-science-101">What programming language should be taught in Computer Science 101?</a> Maybe the question is fundamentally wrong.  </p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 55th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss killer IDEs, how much interview feedback is appropriate (for both parties), and how to teach young programmers who think they know it all.


Server Fault has launched! If you're a sysadmin or IT pro type, please join us there.   
You may have noticed that woot! is the launch sponsor of Server Fault. These sorts of (hopefully) tasteful advertiser relationships underwrite continued development of the site -- and let us do cool things like bring on Geoff Dalgas as Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00003!
What does it mean to be successful as a writer online? Perhaps one metric of success is getting people you respect and admire to link to your writing in an organic, natural way (that is, without asking them to).
Steve Yegge indicated he may blog anonymously or not at all in the future. We suspect that Steve's high profile as a notable software blogger makes it difficult for him at Google, which is a notoriously secretive company. Not Apple secretive, mind you, but close. We agree that as much as Steve writes, it's coming out of him one way or the other, but unfortunately it may be anonymous from this point on. 
If we can render virtual 3D worlds at 60 frames per second, why haven't our software development IDEs evolved much beyond ASCII text for layout? How about visual comments? And Lutz Roeder wonders about Interactive Source Code (ppt). Why not have diagrams in the code, or even better, dynamic visualization of the data structures in that code?  
My thoughts on what it takes to build a killer IDE. I'm still waiting, by the way.  
An analysis of what it takes to have a vibrant add-in ecosystem, while still folding in the most popular add-ins to the core of the product, where they rightfully belong. This is a fine line to walk, particularly for commercial software.
It really is amazing how many problems go away when your software is all open source. Except for the "how do we pay our employees" one.
How much feedback should job interview candidates get when the interview doesn't work out? Joel and I have an extended discussion. This is a lot trickier than it seems at first glance. At some level, perhaps you have to treat job interviews (particularly at extremely selective companies like Fog Creek) like romantic relationships -- sometimes there just isn't chemistry. Rather than over-analyze it, learn what you can, and move on to the next relationship.
Don't ask what programming language beginning programmers should learn -- ask what type of programming do you want to train people to do! Do you want to teach theory, or skill?   
Joel's example of the MIT curriculum of robot programming is a fantastic one: "what they care about is not the actual language. It's not a matter of teaching you the Python, it's teaching you to be a programmer in an environment where everything is constantly falling down around you, nothing as works as documented, even if there were documentation, and there isn't, and if there was documentation, it was probably written by a technical writer who was afraid to go into the programmer's offices because the last time she went in she got her head bitten off."

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 54th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss bespoke software development, URL routing, the God Algorithm, and getting your database under version control.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We need to talk to you about your flair. Specifically, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/nowearn-valuable-flair">your User Flair!</a> It&#39;s a small badge you can embed in your own website to show off your identity and &quot;street cred&quot;, such as it is, on Stack Overflow and Server Fault. If that&#39;s not enough, you can also <a href="http://shirt.social-shirt.com/stackoverflow-shirt.html">put it on a t-shirt</a>. Or dress up like <a href="http://www.eye-wash.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/facebookcostume2.jpg">the Facebook guy</a>. Hey man, these are your life choices, not ours!</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of how <a href="http://www.asp.net/Learn/mvc/tutorial-05-cs.aspx">ASP.NET MVC URL routes</a> should be declared. We do it through an custom attribute attached to the top of the method signature, which we feel provides excellent locality of information.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the promise of Stack Overflow was that it would be run by the community. We are trying to continue delivering on that promise by <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-new-community-moderators/">electing new community moderators</a>, and having a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">moderation policy</a> that all the moderators (including the core team) abide by.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/">Stack Overflow DevDays</a>, &quot;the&quot; <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/default.aspx">Jon Skeet</a> is confirmed to be a speaker at the London DevDays; <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> will be at the Seattle and San Francisco DevDays.</p></li>
<li><p>We now have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/linking-duplicate-questions/">better, AJAX-y support</a> for handling <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/handling-duplicate-questions/">duplicate questions</a>. We believe duplicate mapping is mostly a human-driven task, but we want to streamline the workflow as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of our development style on Stack Overflow is to build features as they become needed, rather than coding speculatively, trying to guess what will become important later. Our <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/">UserVoice site</a> has been very helpful in this regard, as we try mightily to retire the top rated user feature requests and bugs. Well, the ones we agree with, anyway..</p></li>
<li><p>How do you bid on software development projects without cutting corners and still stay competitive? Joel shares his thoughts. &quot;Your job is not to deliver a spec, it&#39;s to step into the client&#39;s shoes and figure out what their problem is, and how it can be solved with computers.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>I maintain this is the blessing and curse of contract software development -- you are a proxy employee during the contract. This can be good, if it&#39;s a client you like and have empathy with, or it can be bad, if it&#39;s a client that you don&#39;t respect, or that you have absolutely nothing in common with. Would you work for that company?</p></li>
<li><p>On the topic of bespoke software, Joel recommends the oddly named book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470345233/?tag=codinghorror-20">How to Castrate a Bull: Unexpected Lessons on Risk, Growth, and Success in Business</a>. Consider selling coffee makers to a hotel -- hotels don&#39;t really want a bunch of coffee machines (even if that&#39;s what they ask for), they want a <em>system</em> that guarantees they never have to think about coffee makers in their rooms again. This is what it means to be &quot;enterprisey&quot;. This is what big consulting firms do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re worried about backdoors in your code, first, don&#39;t work with scumbags. But if you work at an industry where there is a lot of risk, such as banking, then you need an audit trail on everything, and perhaps an internal audit department that does nothing other than check things periodically. A certain percentage of random auditing may be preferable to strict gates on every action.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of O(1), which sort of seems like &quot;The God Algorithm&quot; at first glance. But you do have to define how &#39;big&#39; that 1 is. There are dimensions of space and time here that aren&#39;t immediately apparent.</p></li>
<li><p>One quirk of keeping your database under version control is that you have to make a distinction between the schema, the data, and the fixed data. At the very least, have tools that let you diff your database! And ideally integrate with your build and deployment. Have you looked at the Rails way of handling database changes, with <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">Migrations</a>?   </p></li>
<li><p>Thanks to our podcast sponsor, <a href="http://www.mint.com/jobs">Mint</a> -- they&#39;re looking for a great developer!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Is it true that the more the complex the software system is, the simpler it is to manage, because there are more rules defining its behavior?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;How do you win software development contracts, while still delivering quality?&quot; Based on an existing <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/204572/how-can-a-software-agency-deliver-quality-software-win-projects">question</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;How do you deal with a large codebase, and disgruntled employees leaving backdoors in the code?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115369/do-you-source-control-your-databases">Do you source control your databases?</a> The answer is always yes! Yes! YES<img src="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332952/whats-up-with-o1" alt="  
"></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332952/whats-up-with-o1">What&#39;s Up with O(1)?</a> Worth some thought.</p></li>
</ul>

We need to talk to you about your flair. Specifically, your User Flair!

A brief discussion of how ASP.NET MVC URL routes should be declared. We do it through an custom attribute attached to the top of the method signature, which we feel provides excellent locality of information.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 53rd episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff sit down with <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/">Wil Shipley</a> of <a href="http://delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Monster</a> to discuss the shifting sands of Apple and Microsoft APIs, the value of software development conferences, intuition versus empiricism for developers, and &quot;parrot programming&quot;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Like all the coolest developers, Wil <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2001/05/11/w_talk.html">wrote a web browser</a>. And he&#39;s not shy about mentioning it!</p></li>
<li><p>Wil and Joel reminisce about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT computers</a>, Steve Jobs&#39; gig after he was unceremoniously ousted from Apple by John Sculley. Wil wrote a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective C</a> for NeXT before it was popularized on the Mac.  </p></li>
<li><p>We complain about the fact that Microsoft seems to release a new framework every other year that seems to obsolete the previous framework, as famously documented in Joel&#39;s article <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">How Microsoft Lost the API War</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel announces <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html">Stack Overflow Developer Days</a>, in the platform agnostic spirit of the site. Five cities, a great set of speakers from many different disciplines, one day, $99. And yes, we&#39;re trying to get Wil Shipley to speak at the San Francisco leg.</p></li>
<li><p>Wil has some fantastic advice for software entrepreneurs -- witness his presentation <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/WWDC_Student_Talk.pdf">How to Succeed Writing Mac Software</a> (pdf). It motivated at least one developer to enter the priesthood.</p></li>
<li><p>Some thoughts on the utility of conferences for software developers. You should probably try to go to one conference per year, either because you&#39;re interested in the speakers, or you&#39;re interested in networking with other programmers. Beyond that, the benefits are unclear.</p></li>
<li><p>Wil notes that WWDC is a unique opportunity to get a lot of your detailed Mac programming questions answered by the people who wrote the APIs. Remember, one of the biggest reason to attend these conference is to hang out in the hallways with your fellow developers!</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t think the legendary Apple secrecy is a good strategy for a developer platform. Witness the absurdity of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/07/iphone-nda-doing-more-harm-than-good.ars">iPhone developer NDA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, all those developers who learned about WinFS at Microsoft conferences from 2005 to 2007 must be a little cheesed that the feature never shipped. So it is possible to talk about stuff too early.</p></li>
<li><p>Wil Shipley is also agnostic about unit testing: <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2005/09/unit-testing-is-teh-suck-urr.html">Unit Testing is Teh Suck, Urr</a>. Isn&#39;t using programs to test programs a case of &quot;who watches the watchmen&quot;?

<li><p>Is excessive reliance on unit testing a case of Empiricists versus Intuitionists, as dramatized in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385493002/?tag=codinghorror-20">The Intuitionist</a>? As you get more years of programming experience under your belt, you could argue that you have a (slightly) better &quot;spider sense&quot; of what the problem areas may possibly be in your code.

<li><p>Even a programmer as experienced as Wil occasionally runs afoul of the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001079.html">First Rule of Programming: It&#39;s Always Your Fault</a>.

<li><p>Joel says no question is too simple for Stack Overflow, and we discourage people from responding with RTFM or &quot;too trivial to even ask&quot;. These questions may be simple, but think about each question in terms of future programmers who might encounter this question; is it relevant enough to the world to help them, and not just the one guy or gal with that one ultra-narrow question? If so, then it&#39;s worth asking.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel calls it page faulting in knowledge. Wil calls it &quot;parrot programming&quot;: newbie programmers who don&#39;t really understand what they&#39;re doing, but occasionally get a search result cracker, so that particular programming behavior is rewarded and reinforced. This is why we encourage neophyte programmers to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001108.html">buy a few key programming books</a>, so they can underpin their giant heap of randomly page faulted knowledge with deeper principles and concepts.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Kris</strong>: &quot;What are your thoughts on the value of attending conferences?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clay</strong>: &quot;As you become a more experienced programmer, do you use more intuition as a part of your decision making?&quot;</p></li>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 53rd episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff sit down with Wil Shipley of Delicious Monster to discuss the shifting sands of Apple and Microsoft APIs, the value of software development conferences, intuition versus empiricism for developers, and "parrot programming".


Like all the coolest developers, Wil wrote a web browser. And he's not shy about mentioning it!
Wil and Joel reminisce about NeXT computers, Steve Jobs' gig after he was unceremoniously ousted from Apple by John Sculley. Wil wrote a lot of Objective C for NeXT before it was popularized on the Mac.  
We complain about the fact that Microsoft seems to release a new framework every other year that seems to obsolete the previous framework, as famously documented in Joel's article How Microsoft Lost the API War.  
Joel announces Stack Overflow Developer Days, in the platform agnostic spirit of the site. Five cities, a great set of speakers from many different disciplines, one day, $99. And yes, we're trying to get Wil Shipley to speak at the San Francisco leg.
Wil has some fantastic advice for software entrepreneurs -- witness his presentation How to Succeed Writing Mac Software (pdf). It motivated at least one developer to enter the priesthood.
Some thoughts on the utility of conferences for software developers. You should probably try to go to one conference per year, either because you're interested in the speakers, or you're interested in networking with other programmers. Beyond that, the benefits are unclear.
Wil notes that WWDC is a unique opportunity to get a lot of your detailed Mac programming questions answered by the people who wrote the APIs. Remember, one of the biggest reason to attend these conference is to hang out in the hallways with your fellow developers!
I don't think the legendary Apple secrecy is a good strategy for a developer platform. Witness the absurdity of the iPhone developer NDA.
On the other hand, all those developers who learned about WinFS at Microsoft conferences from 2005 to 2007 must be a little cheesed that the feature never shipped. So it is possible to talk about stuff too early.
Wil Shipley is also agnostic about unit testing: Unit Testing is Teh Suck, Urr. Isn't using programs to test programs a case of "who watches the watchmen"? Also, is every bug ultimately worth fixing?
Is excessive reliance on unit testing a case of Empiricists versus Intuitionists, as dramatized in the book The Intuitionist? As you get more years of programming experience under your belt, you could argue that you have a (slightly) better "spider sense" of what the problem areas may possibly be in your code. Ideally you should use both empiricism and intuition, of course. Nobody programs using the force. Well, except for Knuth.  
Even a programmer as experienced as Wil occasionally runs afoul of the First Rule of Programming: It's Always Your Fault. His anecdote involves writing an email to a VP at Apple, though. Humility is often the best approach; "I think I'm doing something wrong here, can you help me figure this out?"
Joel says no question is too simple for Stack Overflow, and we discourage people from responding with RTFM or "too trivial to even ask". These questions may be simple, but think about each question in terms of future programmers who might encounter this question; is it relevant enough to the world to help them, and not just the one guy or gal with that one ultra-narrow question? If so, then it's worth asking.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 52nd episode of the StackOverflow podcast -- our one year anniversary -- where Joel and Jeff discuss the launch of Server Fault, how you determine if your code is smelly (or just aromatic), how programmers learn by doing, and how good ideas are often too crazy to copy until it&#39;s too late.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We&#39;ve been <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/podcast-1/">podcasting for one full year now</a>. Hopefully we&#39;ve gotten better at this podcast stuff and not worse, but the jury is still out.</p></li>
<li><p>Server Fault, the first sister site to Stack Overflow, is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/">now in private beta</a>. Server Fault is for system administrators and IT professionals. If that&#39;s you, come <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/">join us</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve only done one major branch in Stack Overflow to date, and it was excruciatingly painful in Subversion, even after updating to 1.6 which has &quot;better&quot; support for merging. We&#39;re considering switching to Mercurial to make future merges feel a bit less like gnawing our own limbs off.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel announces that <strong>Fog Creek is working on a hosted version of Stack Overflow</strong>, and they are looking to hire a software engineer to work on the project. If it works out, you get the whole Fog Creek relocation package! If you&#39;ve ever wanted to work on the Stack Overflow codebase (and you&#39;re looking for a full time gig) this is your chance!  </p></li>
<li><p>The prospect of an outside developer looking at our Stack Overflow code base makes us nervous. Maybe this is a healthy reaction -- is any code <em>ever</em> good enough? Probably not.</p></li>
<li><p>We do believe in continuous refactoring, and part of that is developing free from fear. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000123.html">Don&#39;t be afraid to break stuff</a>! Have <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000640.html">some unit tests</a>, and when things do break, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001239.html">be able to fix it very rapidly</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Driven Development is possibly the worst and most incorrect name ever applied to a concept in software engineering, ever. And that&#39;s saying a lot. TDD is more about design than testing, but when every TDD tutorial starts with &quot;ok, we write a test to verify..&quot; it&#39;s sort of hard to justify. Perhaps Behavior Driven Development <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/09/06/bdd-tdd-and-the-other-double-d-s.aspx">would be a better name</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>TDD, as far as testing is concerned may be a bit too programmatic. Never underestimate the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html">power of a skilled human tester</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>We learned ASP.NET MVC as we went. This is a surprisingly common pattern; Joel can&#39;t ever remember a time when he wasn&#39;t building a new application in a new framework. Programming is, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000895.html">almost by definition, continuously learning</a>: your entire career will be one long, unbroken string of learning one new bit of technology after another. Programming is shorthand for learning how to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel asks: as a professional programmer, how often do you start a new major project that&#39;s going to have a long life expectancy? It&#39;s startlingly rare. Even at Fog Creek they&#39;ve had maybe four in the entire time the company has existed. So when you start a new project, you almost have to bet on the new framework that you think will be vibrant and alive five years from now -- that means you&#39;ll be learning as you go, again! There is a double whammy of learning the framework <em>and</em> a language at the same time though -- that&#39;s extra-risky.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of why unconfirmed &quot;no-touch&quot; user actions are so dangerous on the web; they are a XSRF playground! If the user holds a cookie to your site, and an attacker can get them to click on a GET or POST, they have just forced the user to take that action. We added an interstitial confirmation to a few actions to prevent this; the particular case that was extremely dangerous was associating a new OpenID provider in one click. If that OpenID provider was rogue and controlled by the attacker, they now own the account.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel notes that if you&#39;re shy about putting things online, you are letting other people control your online identity -- and that will hurt you <em>much</em> more in the long run than any potentially questionable things you might possibly put online.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the goals of creating Stack Overflow was as a vehicle to build your online identity as a professional programmer, a virtual set of bread crumbs showing that you indeed know your stuff, and your programming peers recognize you for your knowledge.   </p></li>
<li><p>Joel <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/joel-talks-about-stack-overflow-at-google/">gave a speech about Stack Overflow at Google</a> recently. What question did Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, ask?</p></li>
<li><p>A brief mention of <a href="http://stackoverflowoverflow.com/">stackoverflowoverflow</a> ... overflow.  </p></li>
<li><p>By the time anyone tries to copy an iPod, Apple is already a generation ahead. Continual innovation and evolution is always the best approach to defeat those who would blindly copy what you&#39;re doing, and that goes double for software which is infinitely malleable. If your software isn&#39;t continually evolving, it is effectively dead!</p></li>
<li><p>Good ideas sound too crazy for anyone to even consider copying them. The type of people who copy are not interested in anything that remotely resembles risk; they are only going to copy proven successes. So if you&#39;re starting out with a new crazy idea (and you should be!), this is unlikely to be a practical concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s computer has apparently been taken over by a Mexican wrestler named Gordo. I have no idea.   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Paul</strong>: &quot;I&#39;ve seen some companies do background checks online with MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, etcetera. Should developers be concerned about old, embarrassing code being posted online?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tom</strong>: &quot;As a startup entrepreneur, what steps should you take, if any, to protect your intellectual property?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<p>None! Every single <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/1/jeff-atwood">Server Fault question I&#39;ve asked</a> is my favorite this week! I&#39;ve had all these sysadmin and IT pro questions welling up inside me for months, and it was so intensely satisfying to finally be able to ask them and get really great answers. Please <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/">join us in the beta</a>!</p>

We've been podcasting for one full year now. Hopefully we've gotten better at this podcast stuff and not worse, but the jury is still out.
Server Fault, the first sister site to Stack Overflow, is now in private beta. Server Fault is for system administrators and IT professionals. If that's you, come join us!
We've only done one major branch in Stack Overflow to date, and it was excruciatingly painful in Subversion, even after updating to 1.6 which has "better" support for merging. We're considering switching to Mercurial to make future merges feel a bit less like gnawing our own limbs off.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 51st episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff sit down with Joel&#39;s business partner, Michael Pryor of Fog Creek Software, at Stack Overflow world HQ (i.e., Jeff&#39;s house) in El Cerrito, California.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At my home, Joel discovers my secret clock fetish. I have a <a href="http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/jatwood/archive/2005/12/20/The_Pong_clock.aspx">pong clock</a>, a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000760.html">nixie clock</a>, and I&#39;d love to have an <a href="http://web.jfet.org/vclk/">oscilloscope clock</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and Michael went to the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>, one of my favorite places in the world. It&#39;s not just big iron; Michael geeked out over his old Apple //gs, and Joel enjoyed revisiting old HP calculators.  </p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow comments are now <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/comments-top-n-shown/">elevated to the main page</a>. We&#39;ve gone through several user feedback cycles on this, and we feel the current comment layout is a good balance. The preference for this is still in the works. This was partially inspired by the way comments are displayed on <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/04/29/national/w092553D15.DTL&amp;tsp=1">SFGate articles</a> (scroll to the bottom to see how comments are displayed there).</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of the value of meta -- discussing Stack Overflow on Stack Overflow. How much meta is acceptable? Where should meta-discussion go? Isn&#39;t the podcast and the blog meta enough? Is there a need for stackoverflowoverflow?</p></li>
<li><p>One problem is that the system we&#39;ve built is good at focused, directed Q&amp;A but quite bad at arbitrary discussion. It&#39;s why Joel objected to me proposing the use of the Stack Overflow engine for the <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel">Joel on Software discussion boards</a> and the <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz">Business of Software discussion</a> boards. Not a good fit!  </p></li>
<li><p>Consider an analogy with school -- if you don&#39;t like the after school activities students are engaging in, it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t provide a good set of alternatives for them. But perhaps a better analogy is that of students who become teachers; they need a &quot;teacher&#39;s lounge&quot; area.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole point of Stack Overflow is synthesizing _better _answers than what you can commonly find on the open internet. If the answer is already good and easily findable elsewhere on the internet, leave it there! Don&#39;t repost the answer on Stack Overflow unless you&#39;re enhancing and improving the answer in some small way.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/forums/viewthread/6467/">How is Babby Formed</a> has been removed from Yahoo Answers, and we have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/joke-questions-please-refrain/">removed Programming at Sea</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the philosophy of doing lower-level things yourself, such as building your own computers (or even learning C), is to do it enough to understand it -- and learn something along the way. It doesn&#39;t mean that you need to (or even should!) do those things forever, but the journey of learning and discovery is its own reward. The best reference for programmers who want to learn what goes on underneath their code is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735611319/?tag=codinghorror-20">Charles Petzold&#39;s outstanding book, Code</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Learning black hat techniques is important, because <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001123.html">when good is dumb, evil will always triumph</a>. Don&#39;t be dumb. Know what&#39;s out there, and how to exploit it. The morality of studying black hat techniques derives from what you <em>do</em> with that information. Will you sell it? Distribute it and actively attack ? Or quietly disclose it to the vulnerable software or website?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel marvels at the enormous size of the Microsoft campus since he worked there; when he was at Microsoft in the early 90&#39;s, there were around 5,000 employees and it was not uncommon to see Bill Gates walking around the campus. The Redmond visitor center is a disappointment; it should be more like the Computer History Museum, highlighting Microsoft&#39;s central role in so much of that history to date.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently the best estimates are that there are around 9 million programmers in the world, roughly the population of New York City. Imagine a whole city of nothing but programmers. On second thought, that&#39;s too scary -- let&#39;s not.</p></li>
<li><p>A small clarification on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/podcast-50/">last week&#39;s Steve Yegge project</a>; Steve is not the author of the Google JavaScript compiler, but a client of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Peter</strong>: &quot;What do you think about the practice of finding an answer, and re-posting it on Stack Overflow?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Juma</strong>: &quot;Should software engineers learn how the underlying hardware works?&quot;  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766935/what-do-i-need-to-do-in-order-to-be-a-programmer-out-at-sea"></a><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/772596/black-hat-knowledge-for-white-hat-programmers">Black hat knowledge for white hat programmers</a>. Definitely important; if you aren&#39;t performing basic due diligence on what the bad guys do, you&#39;re likely to end up like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001256.html">one of these clowns</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400865/developer-salaries-to-rise">Developer Salaries to Rise?</a> We&#39;re not sure that the number of CS degrees being awarded necessarily correlates with the number of programmers seeking jobs.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 51st episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff sit down with Joel's business partner, Michael Pryor of Fog Creek Software, at Stack Overflow world HQ (i.e., Jeff's house) in El Cerrito, California.


At my home, Joel discovers my secret clock fetish. I have a pong clock, a nixie clock, and I'd love to have an oscilloscope clock!
Joel and Michael went to the Computer History Museum, one of my favorite places in the world. It's not just big iron; Michael geeked out over his old Apple //gs, and Joel enjoyed revisiting old HP calculators.  
Stack Overflow comments are now elevated to the main page. We've gone through several user feedback cycles on this, and we feel the current comment layout is a good balance. The preference for this is still in the works. This was partially inspired by the way comments are displayed on SFGate articles (scroll to the bottom to see how comments are displayed there).
A discussion of the value of meta -- discussing Stack Overflow on Stack Overflow. How much meta is acceptable? Where should meta-discussion go? Isn't the podcast and the blog meta enough? Is there a need for stackoverflowoverflow?
One problem is that the system we've built is good at focused, directed Q&A but quite bad at arbitrary discussion. It's why Joel objected to me proposing the use of the Stack Overflow engine for the Joel on Software discussion boards and the Business of Software discussion boards. Not a good fit!  
Consider an analogy with school -- if you don't like the after school activities students are engaging in, it's because you didn't provide a good set of alternatives for them. But perhaps a better analogy is that of students who become teachers; they need a "teacher's lounge" area.
The whole point of Stack Overflow is synthesizing _better _answers than what you can commonly find on the open internet. If the answer is already good and easily findable elsewhere on the internet, leave it there! Don't repost the answer on Stack Overflow unless you're enhancing and improving the answer in some small way.
How is Babby Formed has been removed from Yahoo Answers, and we have removed Programming at Sea.
Part of the philosophy of doing lower-level things yourself, such as building your own computers (or even learning C), is to do it enough to understand it -- and learn something along the way. It doesn't mean that you need to (or even should!) do those things forever, but the journey of learning and discovery is its own reward. The best reference for programmers who want to learn what goes on underneath their code is Charles Petzold's outstanding book, Code.  
Learning black hat techniques is important, because when good is dumb, evil will always triumph. Don't be dumb. Know what's out there, and how to exploit it. The morality of studying black hat techniques derives from what you do with that information. Will you sell it? Distribute it and actively attack ? Or quietly disclose it to the vulnerable software or website?
Joel marvels at the enormous size of the Microsoft campus since he worked there; when he was at Microsoft in the early 90's, there were around 5,000 employees and it was not uncommon to see Bill Gates walking around the campus. The Redmond visitor center is a disappointment; it should be more like the Computer History Museum, highlighting Microsoft's central role in so much of that history to date.
Apparently the best estimates are that there are around 9 million programmers in the world, roughly the population of New York City. Imagine a whole city of nothing but programmers. On second thought, that's too scary -- let's not.
A small clarification on last week's Steve Yegge project; Steve is not the author of the Google JavaScript compiler, but a client of it.


We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:


Peter: "What do you think about the practice of finding an answer, and re-posting it on Stack Overflow?"

<ul>
<li><p>This episode was recorded on site at the Kirkland, Washington Google office, where Joel gave a talk earlier in the day.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a> language, whose keywords are symbols. Imagine how challenging it would be to program in a language where you need a special keyboard. There&#39;s a more popular (not sure &quot;popular&quot; is the right word) version of APL named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">J</a> which drops the symbols in favor of plain ASCII.</p></li>
<li><p>How big a fan of working at Google is Steve? He worries that new hires from college will expect the rest of their working life to be as good as their Google experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve can finally talk about what he was working on, which he was so vague about on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/podcast-25/">our previous podcast with him</a>. Mostly, he was disturbed at the state of JavaScript tooling at Google -- &quot;dude, you spelled it fuction again.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the art in tools means painstakingly adding support for each individual language into each individual editor. What if there was a way to plug first-class language intellisense / compilation functionality into <em>any</em> editor -- in a generalized way? That&#39;s the problem Steve set out to solve.</p></li>
<li><p>Take compilers that are defined for IDEs -- Eclipse has three Java compilers built into it -- a fast inaccurate one as you type, a better batch one, and then a great big one that does exhaustive analysis on large trees (Steve says Eclipse has &quot;a better Java compiler than the Java compiler&quot;.) This is all necessary to get good editor support! Why not take these compilers and run them on the google infrastructure, so they are commoditized and available to any editor?</p></li>
<li><p>Steve says the way tools and languages integrate today is utterly backwards. Languages should support the tools, rather than the other way around. &quot;We should have been doing this for 20 years!&quot;  </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> doesn&#39;t play well with the JavaScript compiler at Google, partly because nobody has actually tried to compile the code before! It exposes some problems that weren&#39;t immediately obvious. All the common JavaScript frameworks require some tweaking for the JavaScript compilation process.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve likens the comparison between compilation and dynamic typing to taking a shower and brushing your teeth. You should do both! The only reason we <em>can&#39;t</em> do both of these things is because, as Steve points out, our tooling currently sucks.  </p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript has a more interesting origin than I realized -- it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">originally based on Scheme</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Per Steve, Scala is like Haskell but with more concessions to real world programming. He points out that the great thing about Java is the fantastic tooling, which means it&#39;s ultimately a better programming experience than a theoretically &quot;superior&quot; programming language.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel doesn&#39;t hate Unix; FogBugz supports Unix (although that support tends to be complex and costly) and Joel regularly runs <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> on his laptop. That said, modern Unixes have their faults too. Steve observes that the only way to determine what packages are installed on Ubuntu is to diff the dpackage output against a clean machine. Also, Firefox is very slow on Linux relative to Mac and Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow is for programming related questions, but defining programming related isn&#39;t easy. There will <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle/">always be a gray area</a>, which is further complicated by the fact that we do want the _occasional _fun questions -- we just don&#39;t want the system overrun with the stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve points out that even Amazon has examples of &quot;fun&quot; product reviews that wouldn&#39;t normally be permitted, such as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09milk.html?ex=1312776000&amp;en=83840f92baf3863d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">On Amazon, All of a Sudden Everyone&#39;s a Milk Critic</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-About-Ping-Marjorie-Flack/dp/0140502416">The Story About Ping</a>.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;What is Joel&#39;s history with Unix? He mentions Unix a lot in vaguely pejorative ways. Did he have a bad early Unix experience?&quot; No, Steve, the caller did not say &quot;eunuchs&quot;!<br></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow question this week is:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766935/what-do-i-need-to-do-in-order-to-be-a-programmer-out-at-sea">What do I need to do in order to be a programmer out at sea?</a> Exhibit A in the eternal close wars. We aren&#39;t sure this is a valid programming question, but some people object to it being closed. For that matter, some people object to <em>anything</em> being closed.<br></li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 49th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff sit down with Alex Papadimoulis of <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a> to discuss the distinction between IT/sysadmins and programmers, online justice for webforums, user-friendly IDs for databases, and the future of software distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some of our favorite Daily WTF entries: <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/spaced-out.aspx">Spaced Out</a> and <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Straight_Shooter_for_Upper_Management.aspx">Have You Tried JavaScript?</a> Alex likens their writing process to the <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2005/may/vital-signs">Vital Signs</a> column in Discover Magazine.</p></li>
<li><p>As we build up serverfault.com , the already grey area of &quot;which question goes where?&quot; becomes even .. greyer. The<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000462.html"> animal, vegetable, mineral problem</a> is not going away any time soon. That said, if you can attach code to your question, it probably belongs on stackoverflow.com. And if your question involves a server (and no code), it probably belongs on serverfault.com. But there are always exceptions, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/741581/what-are-the-worst-working-conditions-you-have-written-code-in">this question about working conditions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I was surprised to find that there seems to be no critical mass of sysadmin/it bloggers online, certainly no equivalent to the legions of high profile programming bloggers. Thus, we&#39;ll be initially seeding <a href="http://serverfault.com">serverfault.com</a> with those programmers from stackoverflow.com who cross over and also wear the sysadmin/it hat in their work.</p></li>
<li><p>What if there was a programming language that used only abstract symbols instead of existing words in a human language? <a href="http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/courses/ci407su02/students/mthunter/project-final/">There is</a>! But it&#39;s only a research project. (And I found out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">Joel wasn&#39;t kidding about APL!</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Some clarifications about the localization discussion last week. Joel and I continue to disagree about priorities here, is what it boils down to.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and Michael are fans of the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hellban">hellban</a> concept, but I find it to be a bit much like the guys in black masks making people disappear overnight. We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/">implemented a penalty box</a> instead. The hellban might be appropriate for random spammers, but for engaged members of a community, it&#39;s a terrible system of justice. We also <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/">improved our flagging system</a> ala Craigslist so it&#39;s easier to communicate with moderators.  </p></li>
<li><p>The specific source of friction was editing. It turns out that the spirit of an edit is as important as the technical rationale for it. We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/in-defense-of-editing/">love and encourage editing</a>, of course, but it&#39;s possible to follow the absolute letter of the law and still be toxic to the community. Joel says that the typical programming mindset makes us particularly prone to this behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to be able to let things go. One of the curiosities of Wikipedia is that the most obsessed users always win. You can&#39;t compete with someone who devotes hours every day to maintaining their pet topic, with scripts to protect it. This system, on some level, must work because if it didn&#39;t Wikipedia would be permanently broken.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to software increasingly running in the browser via various mechanisms, we view <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">services like Valve&#39;s Steam</a> as the future of software distribution. Ultimately it should be as easy and painless to install software as it is on the closed-ecosystem <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">iPhone and its App Store</a>. The tension between digital distribution and traditional retail channels is still a major hurdle, however.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alex liked this Stack Overflow question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/721497/database-wide-unique-yet-simple-identifiers-in-sql-server">Database-wide unique-yet-simple identifiers in SQL Server</a>. Great question having to do with the human readability of IDs for unique database records. Lots of food for thought. Alex recommends unique lengths per record type, or the &quot;Smart Key&quot; approach of encoding dates and other unique things in the id.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Andy Brice</strong>: &quot;What will happen with the market with downloadable software? Everything in the browser? Hybrid between the downloadable executables and stuff running in the browser? Or will it be business as usual?&quot;<br></li>

<p>Reminder: next week, we&#39;ll have Steve Yegge as a guest. The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/podcast-25/">previous episode with Steve</a> was hugely popular, so hopefully this will be another winner!</p>

<li><p>Joel and I have a long (REALLY LONG) discussion about the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://blog.cnprog.com/2009/01/why-create-cnprog/">Chinese Stack Overflow clone, cnprog</a>.

Until 2004, I felt sort of like that feather in the movie Forrest Gump, or the plastic bag in American Beauty. I had no real plan for my career. This prompted me to think about what I wanted from my career, and it's why I wrote The Eight Levels of Programmers. Think about who you respect, and why, and whether those paths work for you.
If you're very lucky in your career, perhaps you'll be able to build Bongo's Dream House.
Joel and I have a long (REALLY LONG) discussion about the Chinese Stack Overflow clone, cnprog. It's excellent that we are inspiring other programmers, but we do draw the line at copying our look and feel down to the tiniest detail (including the blog). Don't be a content stealing jerk!  
One reason localization has been a very low priority is that we feel for our particular audience, namely programmers, English is the de facto standard language. Not that other languages aren't important, but it's easier to get engineering work done when everything coalesces around a standard language.
It is true that localization is not even close to being on our radar. Programming communities need to form in local languages, too.
We're open to providing a dump of our cc-wiki licensed content, but we don't want to have an AOL data scandal. That would be .. bad. It's the biggest risk blocking that from happening at the moment.
Joel believes that there are five "important" languages that programming content should eventually be localized into: German, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Japanese.
We're beginning the process of promoting a notable user from our community to full-blown moderator status. Shaya Loney, who works at answers.com, had some excellent advice for us -- one of the risks is that when you take one of your best teachers and turn them into the principal of the school, you lose a great teacher. We also want moderators with a variety of different backgrounds for diversity.
We were able to test our datacenter disaster contingency planning a little with a recent server error. Lesson: always have your contingency plans ready to go in practice, not just in theory. We only lost time, but we're considering the use of remote KVMs if this becomes an ongoing concern.
One way to deal with programmers who come off as abrasive and perhaps lack interpersonal skills, is to focus on the specific behaviors that are problematic. Detail the very specific, ultra-narrow things that they could change to improve the way other people react to them.
There's a good reason to fix this, beyond the bad apple theory. As Joel points out, "for marginal performers, the people who don't get along, are probably going to get fired, and the people who everybody likes, are probably going to stay around."
Revisiting the "architect" title. We still think it's a bad idea, but perhaps it's more palatable if you think of it as "software engineer with lots of experience." And get rid of the title! That said, there are the rare few, with Joel's example of Dave Cutler, who truly was the Architect of Windows NT in every possible sense of the word.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 47th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss Eclipse, plugin architectures, sketching mockups, and optimizations that don&#39;t optimize.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had the honor of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001245.html">keynoting EclipseCon this year with Clay Shirky</a>. Eclipse is an open source IDE with an <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/">excellent plugin ecosystem</a>. It&#39;s also a <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/">great Java GUI framework</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of the communal relationship between applications and plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>I am cautiously optimistic about the release of Internet Explorer 8. The betas were <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">very scary</a>, but the final released version is surprisingly solid and fast. A totally respectable update from Internet Explorer 7, and it has a very convenient &quot;switch to IE7 rendering mode&quot; (along with a HTML header that does the same thing) that means it&#39;s super easy to essentially have both browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel explains that he&#39;d rather spend any amount of money than have his developers &quot;take a few weeks&quot; to optimize the FogBugz compiler. Remember, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive</a>. This may include buying 8 GB of memory (cheap!) and the super-fast Intel SSD hard drive. It&#39;s <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/10/so-i-got-one-of-new-intel-ssds.html">recommended by Linus</a>! Be careful with SSDs, the only ones worth having at the moment are the very high end models like the Intel one. Cheaper ones can be <em>slower</em> than regular hard drives!</p></li>
<li><p>I continue to recommend the two-spindle approach for desktops for optimal performance. It&#39;s the same reason, on a database server, you typically have the OS on one drive and the data on another drive. It reduces contention.</p></li>
<li><p>We joke about pure architecture software releases, where nothing <em>visible</em> changes in the product, except the underlying code. There are reasons to do this, such as performance, scalability, and simplicity. But for a product users pay for, a pure architecture release would be suicide.</p></li>
<li><p>Our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/podcast-46/">live podcast from MIX</a> went great -- thanks to everyone who participated! You can watch our 5-minute bit at about 50 minutes into the day one keynote on the <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">official MIX website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The classic example of a <a href="https://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/06/14/how-i-started-an-empire/">free site attacking the business model of a pay site</a> is Markus Frind&#39;s Plenty of Fish. What&#39;s odd is that PoF has been so successful that Markus is looking to <a href="http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/looking-to-aquire/">acquire a pay dating site</a> at this point. On the other hand, he&#39;s adding <a href="http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/plentyoffish-serious-member-profile-upgrade/">some pay features</a> to his free site as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel talks about how smart the design of <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq Mockups</a> is. It actually forces you to stay simple and abstract, which is the whole point of sketching.</p></li>
<li><p>Sketching is on our minds because the Bill Buxton book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0123740371/?tag=codinghorror-20">Sketching User Experiences</a> was provided to every MIX attendee, and Bill Buxton was the first day 1 keynote speaker.   </p></li>
<li><p>Joel complains that so many design books start by talking about the design of the iPod, to the point that it&#39;s cliche. Perhaps one design lesson is that people care more about the content than the design -- the websites they load are far more important than what browser widget they load it in, despite how important choice of browser is to us geeks.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the points Clay brought to our EclipseCon keynote was that social software ends up being a mirror, a reflection of the community you drop it in to. Unlike PhotoShop, which works exactly the same no matter how many times you copy it or who is using it, the same social software may behave completely differently for different communities. This is why Reddit cloning itself into <a href="http://www.weheartgossip.com/">weheartgossip</a> isn&#39;t really working -- the audience is too different.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your &quot;optimizations&quot; are actually optimizing, otherwise you&#39;re pessimizing -- with the best of intentions, you make your code slower. Benchmark first, not last!  </p></li>
<li><p>There are huge categories of premature optimization you should avoid, but you also want to avoid making big design mistakes early on. It&#39;s not necessarily <em>optimization</em>, per se, but don&#39;t do things that are so incredibly boneheaded you will regret them forever.</p></li>

I had the honor of keynoting EclipseCon this year with Clay Shirky. Eclipse is an open source IDE with an excellent plugin ecosystem. It's also a great Java GUI framework.
A brief discussion of the communal relationship between applications and plugins.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 46th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, live from MIX09, where Joel and Jeff answer questions from the live audience.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This podcast is live from the <a href="http://2009.visitmix.com/">MIX09</a> conference! Joel and I also had a small 5 minute segment in the Day 1 keynote, which you can <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">view online</a>. It&#39;s at around the 50 minute mark or so.</p></li>
<li><p>We had a live audience, so the focus of this podcast is on questions from our live audience.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following live audience questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>&quot;What&#39;s the point of Silverlight?&quot;</strong> The short answer is, it&#39;s like Adobe Flash, but much more programmer oriented. <a href="http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight3/default.aspx">Silverlight 3 beta</a> was just launched at MIX, with lots of new developer-y goodness.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;What&#39;s the most number of questions asked by an actual Stack Overflow user?&quot;</strong> That would be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4639">Edward Tanguay</a> with 210 questions, closely followed by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/572">Thomas Owens</a> who asked 207 questions. One reason the &quot;ask a question&quot; button isn&#39;t more prominent on the site is that we encourage people to read and answer a while before asking anything. Good questions take some effort!  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Have you ever considered moving Stack Overflow to the cloud?&quot;</strong> The cloud makes more sense for experimental projects that may or may not succeed. We did the math and decided that owning the hardware was a better deal for our project. It could also make sense for hot-standby disaster recovery backup servers. It depends whether or not you prefer flexibility, or fine-grained control.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;What issues did you have with using ASP.NET MVC?&quot;</strong> Other than the typical beta issues, not much. The big advantage, to us, is that MVC is a much more web-centric development model. It is a much closer match to our mental model of how web programming should work, and how URLs should be formed.  </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;<strong>What does the new guy do on the first day?&quot;</strong> Fix the simplest possible bug in your product. And on the next day, fix a slightly more complex bug. It helps to do this in an environment of active pairing or mentoring.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Are there some things about the web platform (HTML, CSS, etc) that you wish worked differently?&quot;</strong> Sure, the platform barely works. There&#39;s something inspiring about so many programmers are building great stuff on such a rickety platform. And it&#39;s creating a whole new generation of programmers. There&#39;s a certain inexplicable elegance to the madness.  </p></li>
<li><p>*<em>&quot;We have a lot of relatively unstructured data that we&#39;re storing in a database, is there some other way do deal with this? And what about REST vs. SOAP access to it?&quot; *</em> Joel points to <a href="http://adambosworth.net/2004/11/18/iscoc04-talk/">Adam Bosworth&#39;s classic talk</a> about the flexibility of loosely structured data. Perhaps something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene">Lucene</a> or <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> would be a better choice than a traditional rigid database. And remember that meta-tags, while worthless on the open web, are trustworthy on local data. Sometimes you don&#39;t need a perfect 100% right answer back from the data. Joel describes the advantage of REST over SOAP thusly: you can just type stuff into the browser&#39;s address bar and see the results in real time.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Should you teach the framework, or the underlying languages?&quot;</strong> Joel points out that maybe students shouldn&#39;t be studying programming at all. You can learn a lot about programming through related fields. Joel and I disagree a bit on this one. I think good developers are inherently curious, so they can learn the framework and dip into the lower level language as necessary to solve whatever problem is at hand. Joel says you should start with the language and scale up.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;How different is the world view of a programmer who is twenty-something and grew up with the web, versus a thirty-something who didn&#39;t? How important is historical context?&quot;</strong> Can developers who only know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS grow into being generally great developers? I argue that there&#39;s an inherent intellectual curiosity in all great programmers, so they can start <em>anywhere</em> and get amazing results. Joel notes that some of the historical context can become a burden and possibly even incorrect over time. There&#39;s a tension between necessary mentoring between older and younger programmers, and fresh eyes questioning the status quo. It&#39;s good to continually question the programming status quo. Otherwise, how would we make any progress? We&#39;d carry forward our old biases and decisions forever, even after they were no longer necessary.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;At what point in Stack Overflow do you see yourselves hiring specialists? How do we justify bringing in experts to management?&quot;</strong> We already have, to some degree; we have Jeremy Kratz helping us with design and Brent Ozar helping us with advanced database stuff. You have to know your own limitations, what you&#39;re good at and not good at, and how to slice off a small piece of work that&#39;s appropriate for the specialist. If you need to sell this to management, try it on a small part of the project first and show what the difference would be on the full project.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/656549">Stack Overflow on Line 25</a> -- this is one of the downsides of having the name &quot;Stack Overflow&quot;. It&#39;s impressive how good the answers are to a question by a poor, beleaguered end user who just got a stack overflow JavaScript error in their browser</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/656226">Why does setting a stack method result in a Stack Overflow?</a> -- this is a classic example of a mind reading answer. The asker wasn&#39;t able to establish what their question really was.</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/202750/is-there-a-human-readable-programming-language">Is there a human readable programming language?</a> -- yes, until everyone decided that was a really dumb idea. Its name was COBOL.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36707">Should a function have only one return statement?</a> -- a classic discussion question. Discussions are valid as long as they&#39;re focused. Here, the goal is to avoid writing &quot;arrow&quot; or &quot;pacman&quot; code and to keep the functions as small as possible. It&#39;s amazing to us that some developers are still dogmatic about this one. In theory, this is a good rule, but in practice, it isn&#39;t. And practice always overrules theory in my book.<br></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 46th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, live from MIX09, where Joel and Jeff answer questions from the live audience.


This podcast is live from the MIX09 conference! Joel and I also had a small 5 minute segment in the Day 1 keynote, which you can view online. It's at around the 50 minute mark or so.
We had a live audience, so the focus of this podcast is on questions from our live audience.


We answered the following live audience questions on this podcast:


"What's the point of Silverlight?" The short answer is, it's like Adobe Flash, but much more programmer oriented. Silverlight 3 beta was just launched at MIX, with lots of new developer-y goodness.  
"What's the most number of questions asked by an actual Stack Overflow user?" That would be Edward Tanguay with 210 questions, closely followed by Thomas Owens who asked 207 questions. One reason the "ask a question" button isn't more prominent on the site is that we encourage people to read and answer a while before asking anything. Good questions take some effort!  
"Have you ever considered moving Stack Overflow to the cloud?" The cloud makes more sense for experimental projects that may or may not succeed. We did the math and decided that owning the hardware was a better deal for our project. It could also make sense for hot-standby disaster recovery backup servers. It depends whether or not you prefer flexibility, or fine-grained control.  
"What issues did you have with using ASP.NET MVC?" Other than the typical beta issues, not much. The big advantage, to us, is that MVC is a much more web-centric development model. It is a much closer match to our mental model of how web programming should work, and how URLs should be formed.  
"What does the new guy do on the first day?" Fix the simplest possible bug in your product. And on the next day, fix a slightly more complex bug. It helps to do this in an environment of active pairing or mentoring.  
"Are there some things about the web platform (HTML, CSS, etc) that you wish worked differently?" Sure, the platform barely works. There's something inspiring about so many programmers are building great stuff on such a rickety platform. And it's creating a whole new generation of programmers. There's a certain inexplicable elegance to the madness.  
*"We have a lot of relatively unstructured data that we're storing in a database, is there some other way do deal with this? And what about REST vs. SOAP access to it?" * Joel points to Adam Bosworth's classic talk about the flexibility of loosely structured data. Perhaps something like Lucene or CouchDB would be a better choice than a traditional rigid database. And remember that meta-tags, while worthless on the open web, are trustworthy on local data. Sometimes you don't need a perfect 100% right answer back from the data. Joel describes the advantage of REST over SOAP thusly: you can just type stuff into the browser's address bar and see the results in real time.  
"Should you teach the framework, or the underlying languages?" Joel points out that maybe students shouldn't be studying programming at all. You can learn a lot about programming through related fields. Joel and I disagree a bit on this one. I think good developers are inherently curious, so they can learn the framework and dip into the lower level language as necessary to solve whatever problem is at hand. Joel says you should start with the language and scale up.  
"How different is the world view of a programmer who is twenty-something and grew up with the web, versus a thirty-something who didn't? How important is historical context?" Can developers who only know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS grow into being generally great developers? I argue that there's an inherent intellectual curiosity in all great programmers, so they can start anywhere and get amazing results. Joel notes that some of the historical context can become a burden and possibly even incorrect over time. There's a tension between ne...]]></itunes:summary>

<li><p>Joel and I will be at the upcoming <a href="http://2009.visitmix.com/">MIX09</a> conference. We&#39;re also trying to set up a live podcast there on Tuesday, March 17th in the evening.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s essay <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/03/09.html">How to be a Program Manager</a> attempts to explain the essential role this person plays on a software project. It&#39;s a shame the job has such a nebulous title.</p></li>
<li><p>Is writing a functional spec at the heart of agile development? What is a spec, exactly? There has to be something between sitting down and pounding out the code with no planning whatsoever, and meticulously, bureaucratically documenting every tiny detail of your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Not all storyboarding has to be painful. Wireframing the user interface with tools like <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> can take the pain out of a lightweight &quot;functional spec&quot;. Describe every screen, and have some annotations about how stuff is supposed to work. I call this <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001091.html">UI-first software development</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The often cited article <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/001050.php">No Functional Spec</a> doesn&#39;t <em>actually</em> mean no functional spec, if you read it closely. At least in our interpretation of the text.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000962.html">Can your team pass the elevator test?</a> You also need a vision statement or &quot;elevator pitch&quot;. Everyone on your team should be able to explain what your application does, in a few simple paragraphs, to a layman. If they can&#39;t, it&#39;s sign of deeper problems on your project.</p></li>
<li><p>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400082463/?tag=codinghorror-20">Dreaming in Code</a>, which documents the <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/">Chandler project</a>, might be a good example of a project that <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/vision">had a vision statement</a> that hurt the project instead of helping. It described where they wanted to go, but not how they planned to get there. <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a> might be another example -- what does &quot;we&#39;re a social web browser&quot; <em>mean?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Dave Winer maintains that, if you read the description of some new technical thing and can&#39;t understand it after the first readthrough.. it ultimately isn&#39;t important and can be safely ignored.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/82s16/has_joel_spolsky_been_honest_about_his_time_at/">Has Joel Spolsky been honest about his time at Microsoft?</a> Realize that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TwoStories.html">the article in question</a> is one of Joel&#39;s first non-blog blog posts, way back in 2001, describing something that happened in 1992. So it&#39;s ancient history. Joel maintains that <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-April/042999.html">Greg Whitten&#39;s 2005 email</a> is simply the other half of the story. There&#39;s no conflict, just two sides of the same coin.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the talk about how Reddit comments have degenerated, we felt the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">programming reddit</a> comments on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/82s16/has_joel_spolsky_been_honest_about_his_time_at/">Joel article</a> were generally quite insightful.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I are big fans of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Although I have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-value-of-downvoting-or-how-hacker-news-gets-it-wrong/">criticized the lack of downvotes in the Hacker News system</a>, it&#39;s important to note that there is a secret cabal of 30 editors that will kill flagged articles. So it&#39;s not entirely subject to the whims of user voting, either.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel thinks that every hacker who maintains a community comes up with a manifesto that puts them squarely in Clay Shirky <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">a Group is its Own Worst Enemy</a> land. Even he has done it, with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html">Building Communities With Software</a>. You have to make very different decisions based on the size and the composition of the group at any particular time.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I both <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000733.html">dislike threaded discussion formats</a>. When I delved back into threaded discussion this week on the programming Reddit and Hacker News I was reminded how awkward they are. I think developers have a myopia about tree structures, which are incomprehensible to the average person but a daily part of their programming work.</p></li>
<li><p>I was shocked to discover that SQL Server will sometimes look at a parameterized query and come up with an incredibly bad query plan, which it will then store in the query cache, and (even worse!) use over and over! The trick is to use the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlprogrammability/archive/2008/11/26/optimize-for-unknown-a-little-known-sql-server-2008-feature.aspx">optimize for unknown</a> hint, which tells the query plan generator to use a statistical sampling of potential inputs rather than basing its decisions on whatever random parameter happened to be passed in the first time.</p></li>
<li><p>On getting developers to come up with realistic schedules -- first of all, always think in terms of coaching rather than punishment. Punitive measures never work. We recommend following Joel&#39;s advice on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html">evidence based scheduling</a>, which opens with &quot;break it down&quot;.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 45th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss what a program manager does, the value (or lack thereof) of a functional spec and vision statement, building developer community, and planning your development time.


Joel and I will be at the upcoming MIX09 conference. We're also trying to set up a live podcast there on Tuesday, March 17th in the evening.
Joel's essay How to be a Program Manager attempts to explain the essential role this person plays on a software project. It's a shame the job has such a nebulous title.
Is writing a functional spec at the heart of agile development? What is a spec, exactly? There has to be something between sitting down and pounding out the code with no planning whatsoever, and meticulously, bureaucratically documenting every tiny detail of your application.
Not all storyboarding has to be painful. Wireframing the user interface with tools like Balsamiq can take the pain out of a lightweight "functional spec". Describe every screen, and have some annotations about how stuff is supposed to work. I call this UI-first software development.
The often cited article No Functional Spec doesn't actually mean no functional spec, if you read it closely. At least in our interpretation of the text.
Can your team pass the elevator test? You also need a vision statement or "elevator pitch". Everyone on your team should be able to explain what your application does, in a few simple paragraphs, to a layman. If they can't, it's sign of deeper problems on your project.
The book Dreaming in Code, which documents the Chandler project, might be a good example of a project that had a vision statement that hurt the project instead of helping. It described where they wanted to go, but not how they planned to get there. Flock might be another example -- what does "we're a social web browser" mean?
Dave Winer maintains that, if you read the description of some new technical thing and can't understand it after the first readthrough.. it ultimately isn't important and can be safely ignored.
Has Joel Spolsky been honest about his time at Microsoft? Realize that the article in question is one of Joel's first non-blog blog posts, way back in 2001, describing something that happened in 1992. So it's ancient history. Joel maintains that Greg Whitten's 2005 email is simply the other half of the story. There's no conflict, just two sides of the same coin.
For all the talk about how Reddit comments have degenerated, we felt the programming reddit comments on the Joel article were generally quite insightful.
Joel and I are big fans of Hacker News. Although I have criticized the lack of downvotes in the Hacker News system, it's important to note that there is a secret cabal of 30 editors that will kill flagged articles. So it's not entirely subject to the whims of user voting, either.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 44th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the enduring influence of C, the questionable value of the title &quot;Software Architect&quot;, and the evolution of Java.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel brings the YouTube video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHosLhPEN3k">Write it in C</a> to our attention. &quot;Pascal won&#39;t quite cut it, write in C.&quot; Did you know that there&#39;s a new version of C++ on the horizon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x">C++0x</a>? It even has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b0x">its own tag</a> on Stack Overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of C, Joel had lunch (and just guest-taught a class at Princeton for) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>. Brian is of course the co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131103628/?tag=codinghorror-20">the classic K&amp;R book</a>, and the creator of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK_(programming_language)">Awk</a> language. And his second favorite language is Visual Basic, surprisingly.  </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a little bitter that so many languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, etc) followed the &quot;look&quot; and many of the important design decisions of C, but Joel blames <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68">Algol-68</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One C design decision I agree with: using carriage return as your programming line terminator is <em>not</em> a good idea. Having an explicit line ending character like semicolon gives you so much more flexibility, and is far less awkward than weird line continuation characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Extension methods in C# are a poor man&#39;s way of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001151.html">extending the underlying language</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One new feature in C# 4.0 is <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2009/01/22/c-4.0-named-parameters-for-better-code-quality.aspx">named parameter arguments</a>. Joel notes that Excel&#39;s VBA implementation went through this same evolution, and it can potentially mask problems, like &quot;why the heck do we have a function with 7 parameters in the first place?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>We implemented the fantastic open-source <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti tool</a> to graph how much bandwidth and CPU time we&#39;re using on our servers. Our ISP does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing">burstable billing</a> at the 95th percentile, and this graph is built into Cacti. Right now we&#39;re doing about 750 KB/sec or 6 megabits/sec under those terms, which is (unfortunately) more than we agreed on with our ISP. This throughput number is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/happy-100000th-question/">99% GZIP compressed text</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is the rationale for expressing all <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000783.html">network bandwidth units in terms of bits</a>? I prefer bytes. And while I&#39;m at it, what the heck is a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000950.html">kibibyte</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet">Alexa</a>? They&#39;re still around. It is sort of a mystery how sites like Alexa, <a href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, etcetera can infer web traffic for any random website without access to the webserver&#39;s logfiles. It&#39;s essentially client sampling, but the accuracy of this approach is anyone&#39;s guess.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s classic article on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">unnecessary choice in software</a> reminds us how customization is a double-edged sword. We&#39;ve resisted a lot of per-user customization options on Stack Overflow for similar reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I both are unsure that the title &quot;Software Architect&quot; is a good one. We&#39;re leaning towards it being almost.. a net negative. &quot;It&#39;s almost disrespectful of the actual architects who work in construction, to use that word to refer to some kind of high-falutin&#39; big-picture UML-drawing code monkey.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent that the architect is not in the trenches with you doing
the work, they don&#39;t have enough context, and will inevitably make the wrong
decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>If we had the power, we&#39;d do away with the title &quot;Architect&quot;. But if you&#39;re stuck with it -- and the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture astronomy that it frequently engenders</a> -- what is the proper role for a so-called Architect? They <em>could</em> work to connect disparate groups at large organizations, to provide context and reduce duplication for disparate groups that are working in isolation. It can be hard for groups working locally to see the context of the larger organization. But I traditionally think of this role as an evangelist and educator, not an architect.</p></li>
<li><p>The catch-22 of rekindling a nascent programming career is that.. good programmers can&#39;t stop programming. So if you <em>can</em> give up programming, it sort of almost means that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001202.html">you shouldn&#39;t be doing it anyway</a>. This is Joel&#39;s tough love answer. Bottom line: if you want to be a programmer, get out there and start writing code.. yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel thinks that Java on the desktop is essentially dead. I don&#39;t necessarily disagree, but I think Java is still a fine choice on the server. In the context of history, it is an excellent replacement for C++ if you don&#39;t need to-the-metal performance. Joel has called Java &quot;the new VB&quot;, or &quot;the new COBOL&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The enterprisey and extra-verbose culture around Java is a bit problematic. Steve Yegge&#39;s <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">pieces on this are quite famous</a> and apt. Bear in mind, Steve is a guy who has written hundreds of thousands of lines of Java code, and he essentially concluded that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001025.html">size is the enemy</a>.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Brad from Denver</strong>: &quot;How do you get rid of incompetent architects?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ben Younkins:</strong> &quot;I graduated with a CS degree, but I haven&#39;t been working as a programmer for 10 years. I&#39;d like to get back into it. How should I do this?&quot;  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/513170/choosing-a-technology-stack-for-a-small-budget-conscious-business"></a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/577943/how-accurate-are-the-technical-arguments-in-jwzs-ten-year-old-java-sucks-article">How accurate are the technical arguments in JWZ&#39;s ten-year-old &quot;java sucks&quot; article with today&#39;s Java?</a> Jamie Zawinski is a fairly notorious programmer, and these are valid concerns. How do languages evolve, and how has Java evolved in the last 10 years? Is it better? Worse? The same?</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 44th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the enduring influence of C, the questionable value of the title "Software Architect", and the evolution of Java.


Joel brings the YouTube video Write it in C to our attention. "Pascal won't quite cut it, write in C." Did you know that there's a new version of C++ on the horizon, C++0x? It even has its own tag on Stack Overflow.
Speaking of C, Joel had lunch (and just guest-taught a class at Princeton for) Brian Kernighan. Brian is of course the co-author of the classic K&R book, and the creator of the Awk language. And his second favorite language is Visual Basic, surprisingly.  
I'm a little bitter that so many languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, etc) followed the "look" and many of the important design decisions of C, but Joel blames Algol-68.
One C design decision I agree with: using carriage return as your programming line terminator is not a good idea. Having an explicit line ending character like semicolon gives you so much more flexibility, and is far less awkward than weird line continuation characters.
Extension methods in C# are a poor man's way of extending the underlying language.
One new feature in C# 4.0 is named parameter arguments. Joel notes that Excel's VBA implementation went through this same evolution, and it can potentially mask problems, like "why the heck do we have a function with 7 parameters in the first place?"
We implemented the fantastic open-source Cacti tool to graph how much bandwidth and CPU time we're using on our servers. Our ISP does burstable billing at the 95th percentile, and this graph is built into Cacti. Right now we're doing about 750 KB/sec or 6 megabits/sec under those terms, which is (unfortunately) more than we agreed on with our ISP. This throughput number is 99% GZIP compressed text.  
What is the rationale for expressing all network bandwidth units in terms of bits? I prefer bytes. And while I'm at it, what the heck is a kibibyte?
Remember Alexa? They're still around. It is sort of a mystery how sites like Alexa, Compete, etcetera can infer web traffic for any random website without access to the webserver's logfiles. It's essentially client sampling, but the accuracy of this approach is anyone's guess.
Joel's classic article on unnecessary choice in software reminds us how customization is a double-edged sword. We've resisted a lot of per-user customization options on Stack Overflow for similar reasons.
Joel and I both are unsure that the title "Software Architect" is a good one. We're leaning towards it being almost.. a net negative. "It's almost disrespectful of the actual architects who work in construction, to use that word to refer to some kind of high-falutin' big-picture UML-drawing code monkey."
To the extent that the architect is not in the trenches with you doing
the work, they don't have enough context, and will inevitably make the wrong
decisions.
If we had the power, we'd do away with the title "Architect". But if you're stuck with it -- and the architecture astronomy that it frequently engenders -- what is the proper role for a so-called Architect? They could work to connect disparate groups at large organizations, to provide context and reduce duplication for disparate groups that are working in isolation. It can be hard for groups working locally to see the context of the larger organization. But I traditionally think of this role as an evangelist and educator, not an architect.
The catch-22 of rekindling a nascent programming career is that.. good programmers can't stop programming. So if you can give up programming, it sort of almost means that you shouldn't be doing it anyway. This is Joel's tough love answer. Bottom line: if you want to be a programmer, get out there and start writing code.. yesterday.
Joel thinks that Java on the desktop is essentially dead. I don't necessarily disagree, but I think Java is still a fine choice on the server. In the context of history, it ...]]></itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 43rd episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and
Jeff discuss dealing with incompetent programmers, whether salaries should be public, dealing with technical debt, and programming for small businesses.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel is away this week in Florida at the <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/content">Future of Web Applications</a> conference, where he was a speaker. He mentioned that the new <a href="http://280atlas.com/">Atlas web GUI builder</a> was particularly impressive.</p></li>
<li><p>We will try to be more careful about <a href="http://begthequestion.info/">our use of Begs The Question</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel asks about the rationale behind requiring 50 reputation to leave a comment, but allowing a brand new user to post a question or leave an answer. The reason is mostly because we have no mechanism for voting or marking offensive on comments, because they&#39;re ultra-lightweight.</p></li>
<li><p>One way to avoid the dilemma of dealing with bad programmers is to be selective who you work for -- only choose employment at companies where they <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">Hit the High Notes</a>. It&#39;s even in the Joel Test itself: do new hires have to write code?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not a fan of puzzle-based interview processes. I met with a Stack Overflow user this week, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/13/chris-jester-young">Chris Jester-Young</a>, and he revealed a clever and potentially more useful strategy: give interviewees a C program full of bugs, and have them try to debug them! Of course, Chris is a big <a href="http://codegolf.com/">Code Golf</a> enthusiast, so of course he nailed that one.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes you have to try to change your organization to fix the root problems, otherwise you&#39;re just fighting the symptoms and not the disease itself. This can be quite a challenge when you have no real authority. Joel offers some advice in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000332.html">Getting Things Done When You&#39;re Only a Grunt</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there happy incompetents? I argue that there are; Joel argues that there aren&#39;t. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/health/011800hth-behavior-incompetents.html">Among the Inept, Ignorance is Bliss</a>. Perhaps the better question to ask is, how can you help this marginal programmer find a career they&#39;ll enjoy? Many so-so programmers can make outstanding testers, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>We wonder: what would it be like to work at a commercial for-profit company where everyone&#39;s salaries were public knowledge? I imagined it as something like The Lord of the Flies. Just make sure you aren&#39;t Piggy!  </p></li>
<li><p>At Fog Creek, salaries aren&#39;t technically public, but they have a formula through which everyone&#39;s pay can be derived. This is the <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/Ladder.html">Fog Creek Professional Ladder</a>. Fog Creek also does profit sharing, so when the company does well, everyone does well.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a two-class society at Microsoft, between Testers and Developers? Joel wonders why they need different titles. I had always heard Microsoft did a great job of giving test engineers a viable parallel career track.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel believes manipulating compensation to motivate people does not work, almost by definition. Top developers will do a good job no matter what compensation system you put in front of them. It&#39;s a &quot;blunt instrument&quot; that can cause as much harm as good. Joel is an advocate of &quot;taking salary discussion off the table, paying people fairly and justly and well, so they can stop worrying about it so much.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>We have a lot of anti-bot code on Stack Overflow. What we didn&#39;t think about was <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/new-question-answer-rate-limits/">human-entered spam</a>! Now we do -- yet another example of the incredible power of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001228.html">rate limiting techniques</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On matters of customer service, we do endeavor to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">not make the situation worse</a>. Start practicing saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s our fault.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Updates may slow down on Stack Overflow for a little while. We have built up <a href="http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2007/11/01/technical-debt-2.aspx">a lot of technical debt</a> around our database, and we have to hunker down and refactor a few core database tables that affect 80% of our code. If you don&#39;t pay down your technical debt every so often, you could end up like Twitter -- a reliability laughingstock. But, somehow, still successful.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s something liberating and energizing about going in and tearing down huge parts of your application to rebuild it and make it better. Unlike our previous discussion on learning languages, I&#39;m more of an advocate of the big bang model here, whereas Joel proposes something more incremental.</p></li>
<li><p>If you work in programming or IT for a small business, can you give an elevator pitch explaining the value you bring to the business to the powers that be? Are you scaling your solutions to the size of your business, and not over-engineering it? What can you outsource, versus what is strategic?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<li><strong>Matt Rogish</strong>: &quot;How does one ethically get rid of of incompetent programmers?&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

Fix that first, if you can.<br></li>

Joel is away this week in Florida at the Future of Web Applications conference, where he was a speaker. He mentioned that the new Atlas web GUI builder was particularly impressive.
We will try to be more careful about our use of Begs The Question.
Joel asks about the rationale behind requiring 50 reputation to leave a comment, but allowing a brand new user to post a question or leave an answer. The reason is mostly because we have no mechanism for voting or marking offensive on comments, because they're ultra-lightweight.
One way to avoid the dilemma of dealing with bad programmers is to be selective who you work for -- only choose employment at companies where they Hit the High Notes. It's even in the Joel Test itself: do new hires have to write code?

<ul>
<li><p>The Conversations Network, a non-profit organization that graciously underwrites the bandwidth costs of <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">this and many other great podcasts</a>, is looking for a sponsor. Email us at <a href="mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com">podcast@stackoverflow.com</a> if you know of any   </p></li>
<li><p>We finally rolled out <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/now-showing-email-notifications/">email support</a> at Stack Overflow. If you haven&#39;t been to the site in 7 days, and have provided a valid email address, we include all the responses to your questions and answers (if any) in that period. And of course there is a true one-click unsubscribe. We&#39;re still tweaking the parameters of how it works -- what is the optimal email relationship between a user and a website?</p></li>
<li><p>Sending email these days is a bit of a minefield. How do you avoid instantly going into people&#39;s spam folder? One key piece is having a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup">Reverse PTR record</a>, which is set up at the ISP level. There&#39;s a whole <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deliverability.com%2F&amp;ei=b3ScSd3nDInKtQOssJ22Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-U4owVOVUDWrqCyubM4j0PPR_Iw&amp;sig2=eb0yfFRGAFszaO0jGXDTbQ">&quot;Deliverability&quot;</a> industry around sending email to people.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re encouraged by the emerging standard of entering your OpenID provider&#39;s address as your OpenID login. For example, &quot;yahoo.com&quot; works for Yahoo OpenIDs, and eventually &quot;gmail.com&quot; will work for Google. (Today you must use &quot;google.com/accounts/o8/id&quot; for Google, which is not optimal for hopefully.. obvious.. reasons.) Microsoft is also coming on board, though their OpenID support is in private beta.</p></li>
<li><p>We also implemented gold and silver <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/specialist-badge-implemented/">tag-based badges</a>, based on upvotes within a tag. It&#39;s a way of rewarding people who participate heavily in certain topic areas. We did have to rule out discussion based questions for this algorithm to work. We are also considering a tag leaderboard, as suggested by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/893/greg-hewgill">Greg Hewgill</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Our backup strategy has been half-hearted so far. To improve this, we invested in an inexpensive embedded Linux based 1u Network Attached Storage device, the <a href="http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=103">QNAP 409u</a>. This will become our dedicated backup device. It has four drive bays and supports RAID 6 (dual parity). Kind of a neat little device; there&#39;s a whole subculture of inexpensive NAS devices I hadn&#39;t explored until now. <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a>, for example.  </p></li>
<li><p>As it turns out, the cost of bandwidth ends up being the gating factor for us when dealing with our daily multiple - gigabyte database backups. Jim Gray had an eye opening piece on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000783.html">the economics of bandwidth</a> and the surprising effectiveness of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">&quot;sneakernets&quot;</a>, even today.</p></li>
<li><p>How likely is it that your datacenter is going to explode? Unless you have a fancy multiple datacenter setup for redundancy, it might be more effective to do some trickle uploads to services like Amazon S3, or even some monthly datacenter driving runs to copy data off using a cheap USB 2.5&quot; hard drive. Luckily, one of our team members lives a mile from the data center, so that&#39;s the approach we&#39;ll be using.</p></li>
<li><p>We had some semi-serious issues with our IBM ServeRAID 8k controller, having to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache#Operation">write-through versus write-back caching</a>. Write-through blocks on actual disk writes, whereas write-back writes to a fast RAM buffer, returns very rapidly, and spools the writes over time (e.g. &quot;lazy writes&quot;). The performance of write-back is dramatically better, but we were seeing some eventual system-wide I/O blocking under heavy write load with write-back caching on. Supposedly this is normal for some RAID controllers, but we opted to downgrade to write-through because the nightly backups would always trigger this behavior for us.  </p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of blocking: it&#39;s funny how many of the techniques discussed on <a href="http://highscalability.com/">the High Scalability blog</a> boil down to hashtables in memory. Memory is one of the fastest things you have in a computer, and it almost never blocks for any significant amount of time. Unlike, say.. hard disks or network.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of trying to learn a new language will make you a better developer. Where do you go if you only know PHP? I think you should go to Java or C# to build up a bit more structure, then to Python or Ruby to tear down that structure, as a sort of natural ebb and flow progression journey that I&#39;ve seen a lot of developers make over time. Joel disagrees, and thinks thinks you should go for something radical right out of the gate, like Haskell. &quot;At some point it has to blow your mind, or you&#39;re not learning.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Joel recommends the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">classic Abelson and Sussman lectures</a> on Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. This of course complements the freely available on-line version of the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP textbook</a>. Go blow your mind! &quot;Once you learn those concepts, you&#39;ll write better code in any language.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Is it an legitimate argument to say that, if you haven&#39;t tried something, you&#39;re not entitled to have an opinion about it? How much does it add to your opinion to have experience in a subject? Joel references Paul Graham&#39;s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html">How to Disagree</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Shouldn&#39;t every software project you work on be a learning experience, regardless of whether the software ever sees the light of day? Why would you work on a project that isn&#39;t teaching you anything at all?  </p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to help programmers who can&#39;t help themselves? We&#39;re not sure throwing a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670/codinghorror-20">Code Complete</a> at a sub-par developer will necessarily make them any better. I believe pair programing and mentoring is the only way to get this to work, insofar that it ever does. And tread very lightly here, because it&#39;s quite possible to make things <em>worse</em> by being didactic or overbearing.   </p></li>
<li><p>How do you fix not caring? How do you fix lack of motivation? Perhaps the better way to look at this is to keep your project inherently interesting and relevant. Convince your teammates that you&#39;re working on something that <em>matters</em>, at least in some small way. Are we happy with what we&#39;re doing? And if not, how can we fix that?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>MichaÅ Tataranowicz:</strong> &quot;I am a PHP web developer. I want to learn a new language to improve my skills. What language should I learn? It doesn&#39;t have to be useful for web development, although it would probably help.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Adam from PA: &quot;I work for a R&amp;D group at a large defense contractor, I&#39;ve been told my project is ending. How do I keep my motivation going when I know this project is going to be put on a shelf and not used?&quot;  </p></li>

As it turns out, the cost of bandwidth ends up being the gating factor for us when dealing with our daily multiple - gigabyte database backups. Jim Gray had an eye opening piece on the economics of bandwidth and the surprising effectiveness of "sneakernets", even today.
How likely is it that your datacenter is going to explode? Unless you have a fancy multiple datacenter setup for redundancy, it might be more effective to do some trickle uploads to services like Amazon S3, or even some monthly datacenter driving runs to copy data off using a cheap USB 2.5" hard drive. Luckily, one of our team members lives a mile from the data center, so that's the approach we'll be using.
We had some semi-serious issues with our IBM ServeRAID 8k controller, having to do with write-through versus write-back caching. Write-through blocks on actual disk writes, whereas write-back writes to a fast RAM buffer, returns very rapidly, and spools the writes over time (e.g. "lazy writes"). The performance of write-back is dramatically better, but we were seeing some eventual system-wide I/O blocking under heavy write load with write-back caching on. Supposedly this is normal for some RAID controllers, but we opted to downgrade to write-through because the nightly backups would always trigger this behavior for us.  
Speaking of blocking: it's funny how many of the techniques discussed on the High Scalability blog boil down to hashtables in memory. Memory is one of the fastest things you have in a computer, and it almost never blocks for any significant amount of time. Unlike, say.. hard disks or network.
The act of trying to learn a new language will make you a better developer. Where do you go if you only know PHP? I think you should go to Java or C# to build up a bit ...]]></itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 41st episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff sit down with <a href="v">Robert Martin aka &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;</a>, and discuss software quality, the value of software engineering principles, and test-driven development.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel clarifies that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html">some of his comments</a> in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/podcast-38/">Podcast #38</a> were a bit unintentionally ad-hominem, and apologizes to Uncle Bob for that -- see <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/06/on-open-letter-to-joel-spolsky-and-jeff-atwood">Bob&#39;s open letter blog post</a>. But on the positive side, it did get us a podcast with Uncle Bob!</p></li>
<li><p>This was a big week for Stack Overflow; we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/new-datacenter-migration/">moved to a new hosting provider</a> -- <a href="http://www.peakinternet.com/business/hosting/info.php">PEAK Internet</a> in Corvallis. We did have a few blips with DNS but other than that the move was relatively smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing our servers from 4 GB (web) and 4 GB (database) to 8 GB and 24 GB, respectively, opened up tons of breathing room and unleashed a lot of latent performance. Memory is <em>incredibly</em> cheap right now; there&#39;s no reason not to install ridiculous amounts. It is (almost) free performance. Bob reminisces about when he bought memory by the <strong>bit</strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>When <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/01/31/quality-doesnt-matter-that-much-jeff-and-joel">I said &quot;quality doesn&#39;t matter&quot;</a>, I didn&#39;t mean it literally. If you deliver a software product that nobody likes or wants to use, it doesn&#39;t matter how great the quality of your code is. You can always fix code quality -- but fixing &quot;nobody gives a crap about our product&quot; is far more difficult. That&#39;s what you should be worrying about most of all.  </p></li>
<li><p>Quality has many dimensions. The cleanest code in the world could utterly miss the point on usability, scalability, performance, and meeting users&#39; expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, as Bob points out, there are companies that have shipped broken products which permanently damaged their reputations and, in some cases, even forced themselves out of business.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob&#39;s <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> are based on some well known conventions. I talked about the first one, the Single Responsibility Principle, in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000805.html">Curly&#39;s Law: Do One Thing</a>. You may have heard this before as Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself (DRY), Once and Only Once, or Single Point of Truth.</p></li>
<li><p>We wonder if some of these guidelines -- such as &quot;deploy independently&quot; -- are obviated by the inevitable forward march of technology, such as software delivered through the cloud, and virtual machines.</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when principles fall into the hands of people who don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re doing? Or people who become bureaucrats, rigidly enforcing rules on everyone? We think the existence of rules, in and of itself, isn&#39;t necessarily a net good. The types of developers who need those rules are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001004.html">often immune to them</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Often, software developed internally doesn&#39;t have to be good; users are forced to use it. This software would never survive as a real product that had users who actually had to want to pay for and use the software. Bob is fond of asking &quot;why is open source software so much better&quot;; part of the reason is that this software has to survive in the real world on its own merits to garner users and attentions. It&#39;s not isolated on some peculiar little corporate Galapagos island where it has no competition.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel worries that excessive TDD (say, going from 90% to 100% test coverage) cuts time from other activities that could benefit the software product, such as better usability or additional features users are clamoring for.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit tests are absolutely useful as a form of &quot;eating your own dogfood&quot;, and documenting the behavior of your system. Even if you disregard the actual results of the tests completely, they&#39;re still valuable as documentation and giving you a fresh outside perspective on your codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel notes the difficulty of testing the UI (web or executable) versus testing the code behind the UI. The classic method of doing this is probably documented in <a href="http://catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/">The Art of UNIX Programming</a>, where you start with a command-line app that takes in and spits out text. The GUI is simply a layer you paste on top of the command-line app, which leads to perfect testability -- but perhaps not such great apps, in the long run. Which is more important?</p></li>
<li><p>The hidden context of wondering whether a large switch statement you&#39;ve written is the right choice is that <em>you&#39;ve already won</em> -- the types of developers who are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001020.html">actively thinking about their work</a> aren&#39;t really the problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/505454/large-switch-statements-bad-oop">Large Switch statements: Bad OOP?</a> The idea that giant switch statements are fundamentally evil is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. It really depends how simple and straightforward you can make the switch statement.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered one listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Andrew Davis</strong>: &quot;My rule of thumb is that unit tests should be written for clearly defined code that has highly constrained input going in and coming out. Is it even worth writing tests for GUI code?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tim Kington</strong>: &quot;True test-driven development has one benefit you didn&#39;t talk about: you can approach your code from the perspective of the client.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

Joel and Jeff sit down with Michael Lopp, aka Rands, to discuss how a geek manages other geeks, the dangers of working remotely, the pitfalls of offshoring, and some techniques for continual learning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may know Michael Lopp from his excellent blog, <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a>. We highly recommend the <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/cat_best_of.html">Best Of category</a> if you haven&#39;t visited Rands before. Heck, even if you have.  </p></li>
<li><p>Rands is a Manager of Humans, and many of the entries on his blog are a fantastic resource for other Managers of Humans. &quot;A lot of people stuff on a daily basis, it&#39;s 60 to 70 percent of my day.&quot; He wrote a book on this topic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159059844X/?tag=codinghorror-20">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you transition from being a software developer to a manager, you will almost never write code. As a manager, how do you balance writing code -- if only as a form of daily exercise, to keep your skills sharp -- with the rest of what you do?  </p></li>
<li><p>The #1 management skill? Listening. Which means Joel and I should probably never be managers.</p></li>
<li><p>The magical number of people one person can manage without having serious problems is seven. Beyond that, you&#39;re probably not giving the people on your team enough attention.</p></li>
<li><p>On managing geeks and nerds: it should be done systematically. They like <em>structure</em>, and you have to put that around this messy business of us being human beings. Perhaps <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html">the handbook</a> will be of use.</p></li>
<li><p>Leading by example can only get you so far. What do you do when you inherit the world&#39;s best programmer in some language you don&#39;t even know? It&#39;s much more hands on than that. Your strengths are not your team&#39;s strengths.</p></li>
<li><p>Building a so-called Nerd Playground is one way to attract talented developers. But as Joel says, &quot;10% of the joy of coming in to work is that it&#39;s a great place to work, and 90% is that I love these people.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The danger of working remotely is that there&#39;s a lot of non-verbal communication that typically goes on. Our tentative recommendation for working remotely, if you must do it, is to have frequent intervals where you all come together multiple days and work together. In order for the remote relationship to work, there has to be a face to face relationship in place to support it.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael asks about the Stack Overflow badge system, which was explicitly modelled on the <a href="http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/680/680891p1.html">Xbox 360 Achievements system</a>. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold badges are there to support beginners, intermediates, and the hardcore respectively. The idea that you have to figure out why you got a badge is there very much by design; the mystery is part of the fun.</p></li>
<li><p>There were complaints that answers came too fast on Stack Overflow, which <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/solving-the-fastest-gun-in-the-west-problem/">we have hopefully addressed</a> -- there is an art to answering questions quickly and effectively. If anything, Stack Overflow &quot;games&quot; you into learning how to progressively answering other people&#39;s questions more and more effectively over time. How, exactly, is this a bad thing?</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of offshoring. &quot;If people were getting as much value out of remote developers as local developers, then the price would be the same.&quot; It&#39;s also difficult to get good results out of teams when their skin isn&#39;t in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>While I am deeply uncomfortable with using Stack Overflow as a hiring tool, it is totally reasonable to use it as a &quot;breadcrumb trail of your awesomeness&quot; as a programmer. If your questions and answers are well written and clear, and getting upvoted by your peers, that is something to be proud of.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you manage continually learning? Reading, writing, and practice of the things you enjoy. It is possible to take this too far, though, and become <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000916.html">a magpie developer</a>. One advantage of older developers is that they have <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000576.html">more failures under their belt</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael looks for a combination of ego and humility when he hires -- these are somewhat contradictory traits, but they balance and complement each other.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Joel:</strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/201189/what-do-you-do-to-keep-learning">What do you do to keep learning?</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/502492/i-was-recently-asked-for-my-stackoverflow-rep-score-in-a-job-interview-is-that-a">I was recently asked for my stackoverflow rep score in a job interview. Is that appropriate?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered one listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;What makes a great software development manager? Should he or she be a good developer to be a manager?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alex</strong>: &quot;What do you think of the feasability of building a workforce of people who work remotely from home?&quot;  </p></li>

Joel and Jeff sit down with Michael Lopp, aka Rands, to discuss how a geek manages other geeks, the dangers of working remotely, the pitfalls of offshoring, and some techniques for continual learning.


You may know Michael Lopp from his excellent blog, Rands in Repose. We highly recommend the Best Of category if you haven't visited Rands before. Heck, even if you have.  
Rands is a Manager of Humans, and many of the entries on his blog are a fantastic resource for other Managers of Humans. "A lot of people stuff on a daily basis, it's 60 to 70 percent of my day." He wrote a book on this topic, Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager.
If you transition from being a software developer to a manager, you will almost never write code. As a manager, how do you balance writing code -- if only as a form of daily exercise, to keep your skills sharp -- with the rest of what you do?  
The #1 management skill? Listening. Which means Joel and I should probably never be managers.
The magical number of people one person can manage without having serious problems is seven. Beyond that, you're probably not giving the people on your team enough attention.
On managing geeks and nerds: it should be done systematically. They like structure, and you have to put that around this messy business of us being human beings. Perhaps the handbook will be of use.
Leading by example can only get you so far. What do you do when you inherit the world's best programmer in some language you don't even know? It's much more hands on than that. Your strengths are not your team's strengths.
Building a so-called Nerd Playground is one way to attract talented developers. But as Joel says, "10% of the joy of coming in to work is that it's a great place to work, and 90% is that I love these people."
The danger of working remotely is that there's a lot of non-verbal communication that typically goes on. Our tentative recommendation for working remotely, if you must do it, is to have frequent intervals where you all come together multiple days and work together. In order for the remote relationship to work, there has to be a face to face relationship in place to support it.
Michael asks about the Stack Overflow badge system, which was explicitly modelled on the Xbox 360 Achievements system. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold badges are there to support beginners, intermediates, and the hardcore respectively. The idea that you have to figure out why you got a badge is there very much by design; the mystery is part of the fun.
There were complaints that answers came too fast on Stack Overflow, which we have hopefully addressed -- there is an art to answering questions quickly and effectively. If anything, Stack Overflow "games" you into learning how to progressively answering other people's questions more and more effectively over time. How, exactly, is this a bad thing?
A brief discussion of offshoring. "If people were getting as much value out of remote developers as local developers, then the price would be the same." It's also difficult to get good results out of teams when their skin isn't in the game.
While I am deeply uncomfortable with using Stack Overflow as a hiring tool, it is totally reasonable to use it as a "breadcrumb trail of your awesomeness" as a programmer. If your questions and answers are well written and clear, and getting upvoted by your peers, that is something to be proud of.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 39th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss database design and the shell game of performance, the value of short, focused presentations, and the importance (or not) of a prestigious degree for software engineers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel insisted that we run the stackoverflow.com books on <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/">QuickBooks</a>. I was more open to using an online accounting solution, but we were worried about someone holding our business finances hostage. Joel also maintains that &quot;every accountant in the world knows QuickBooks&quot;. I&#39;m not happy about it, but small business reality.  </p></li>
<li><p>Now that we can (theoretically) afford to pay ourselves to work on the site, we deployed two new features: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/reputation-bounty-for-unanswered-questions/">reputation bounties on questions</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-replies-notification/">new reply notifications</a>.   </p></li>
<li><p>Joel expresses some concern about the value of <a href="http://video.dld-conference.com/watch/Q1G0GQR">panel discussions</a> at conferences. There are lots of variables: who is on the panel, what are the topics, and how skilled is the moderator? It&#39;s almost better to give each person on the panel a 10 minute window to talk about some topic they think will have value for the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>I often think of small, focused presentations as &quot;Grok Talks&quot;.

<li><strong>Michael Coney</strong>: &quot;Joel mentioned the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> on the previous podcast. Our software architect was also fond of over-isolation but was talked out of it. In the real world, if you need to change something, you just rewrite it.&quot;</li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 39th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss database design and the shell game of performance, the value of short, focused presentations, and the importance (or not) of a prestigious degree for software engineers.


Joel insisted that we run the stackoverflow.com books on QuickBooks. I was more open to using an online accounting solution, but we were worried about someone holding our business finances hostage. Joel also maintains that "every accountant in the world knows QuickBooks". I'm not happy about it, but small business reality.  
Now that we can (theoretically) afford to pay ourselves to work on the site, we deployed two new features: reputation bounties on questions and new reply notifications.   
Joel expresses some concern about the value of panel discussions at conferences. There are lots of variables: who is on the panel, what are the topics, and how skilled is the moderator? It's almost better to give each person on the panel a 10 minute window to talk about some topic they think will have value for the audience.
I often think of small, focused presentations as "Grok Talks". One presentation format which hews closely to this model is Pecha Kucha. It's generally a good idea to err on the side of keeping it small. The larger the talk, the more material you should have whittled away and deleted to get it down to size.
In building Stack Overflow, we copied a key part of the Wikipedia database design. This turned out to be a mistake. We are due for a massive database refactoring, which is going to be very painful, but it is necessary to avoid excessive joins in a lot of our key queries.
We also begin to appreciate why the giant multi-terabyte table schemas (like Google's BigTable) are completely join-free, basically simple hashtables or tuples spread across a server farm.

You're playing another shell game, so decide what axes of that resource balancing equation are important to you. Perhaps the greatest risk is being dogmatic about it.  
If you enjoy this podcast, you might also enjoy Hanselminutes -- Joel gives it his seal of approval!
Joel revisits the SOLID principles, and compares them to designing replaceable batteries, or a headphone jack, into your product. Appropriate in some narrow cases, but not all the time. Imagine a consumer product where every single part of it could be plugged in and replaced with another compatible part. Is that realistic?
Perhaps new language features will advance programming a lot faster than any given set of programming principles, no matter how good they are. I've often thought that design patterns are how languages evolve.
Joel says you don't have to go to a prestigious name brand school, necessarily, but you need to choose schools that have a rigorous selection process. "These people are a tiny little bit more likely to succeed at our rigorous selection process." I concur -- if you aren't seeking out challenges, whether they are large, small, or somewhere in-between -- what are you doing?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 38th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss YSlow optimizations for large websites, the value of unit testing, and the hidden pitfalls of asking questions to programmers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel notes that simply paying attention to what your coworkers are doing is an effective way to build and lead a team. If you aren&#39;t interested in what your teammates are doing.. why are you on that team, again?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve followed the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">excellent Yahoo YSlow tool</a> for a while. It really is intended for large scale websites, as I&#39;ve <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000932.html">noted before</a>. But Stack Overflow is exactly the type of website that can benefit from YSlow recommendations!</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve been using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires">Expires or Cache-Control Header</a> since we launched. This saves the browser round-trips when getting infrequently changing items, such as images, javascript, or css. The downside is that, when you do actually change these files, you have to remember to change the filenames. A part of our build process now &quot;tags&quot; these files with a version number so we no longer have to remember to do this manually.</p></li>
<li><p>We also integrated the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI Compressor</a> into our build, to minify our CSS and JavaScript resources. We had <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/YUICompressor">bad luck with the .NET port</a> of this tool, so we just shell out to Java in the build. Works great, although we had some crazy pathing issues that made us put the JAR file in the root.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s also possible for Google to <a href="http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/speed-up-access-to-your-favorite.html">host your shared javascript files</a>, if you&#39;re using a popular third party JS library. We chose not to do this because we package related JavaScript together, so it would defeat the benefits of packaging.</p></li>
<li><p>Browsers will parallelize their requests, but only so many requests can be &quot;in flight&quot; to the same domain. So it can be wise to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#split">split your website components across domains</a>. Simple aliases such as a.mydomain.com seem to work fine for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel explains <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites">CSS sprites</a>, which is an effective way to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http">minimize the number of HTTP requests</a> your website is generating. This is particularly useful on toolbars and the like which contain a lot of related images.</p></li>
<li><p>There are analogs here in the Strings tab of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">Process Explorer</a>, and the <a href="http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_strings.htm">UNIX command Strings</a>, as well as classic Windows resource browsing -- spelunking for whatever icons and image resources you can find in a file.</p></li>
<li><p>This is all important because I want Stack Overflow to be as fast as possible. Performance is a feature, and I think often underestimated. Even <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000722.html">half a second delay can cause a 20% drop in traffic</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We discuss differential database backups and DNS time to live, to make the upcoming site transition to new harware as painless as possible, and minimize downtime. We&#39;ll also update the old site with a static HTML page that tells you you need to flush your DNS.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel notes that his partner Michael had to order thermal compound back in 2000 when he built up PCs for Fog Creek. This stuff is important! Please <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/goop.htm">don&#39;t use vegemite</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We finally fixed our paging algorithm, which had some aggravating edge condition bugs. I dedicate this fix to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1450/john-topley">John Topley</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I have some reservations about unit testing, at least the dogmatic test-first kind, where your goal is to have code coverage in the 95%+ range. It seems to us that this works best for legacy type applications that aren&#39;t changing very much. At some level, the tests become friction preventing you from making changes, as every change results in a stack of failing tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel talks about Robert Martin&#39;s (aka Uncle Bob) <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">Solid Principles</a>, as explained on a <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=163">recent Hanselminutes podcast</a>. Joel: &quot;it sounded like extremely bureaucratic programming&quot; that &quot;could theoretically protect you against things, but You Aren&#39;t Gonna Need It.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re building a framework or API, something
designed to be used by thousands or millions of developers, then having
a lot of unit tests -- or Uncle Bob&#39;s Principles of OOD -- might make sense. Principles and rules are fine, but thinking about what you&#39;re doing should <em>always</em> come first.</p></li>
<li><p>The implied part of any question is whether the question <em>even makes sense</em>. I&#39;ve always loved Alex Papadimoulis&#39; take on this, he &quot;nailed&quot; it with <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/archive/2005/05/25/408925.aspx">Pounding a Nail: Old Shoe or Glass Bottle?</a></p></li>
<li><p>Software developers are trained from birth to ask why; when you ask a programming question, ignore that at your peril. And, please, when you see good questions, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2824/stackoverflow-why-arent-people-rating-questions">vote them up!</a>  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>*<em>Jeff: *</em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/456815/problems-with-html-marquee-tag">Problems with the MARQUEE HTML tag</a>. I love that we&#39;re reaching out to developers who ask naive (but earnest!) questions like this.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joel</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/392397/arrays-whats-the-point"></a><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/405288/sql-server-after-insert-trigger-doesnt-see-the-just-inserted-row">SQL Server &quot;AFTER INSERT&quot; trigger doesn&#39;t see the just-inserted row</a>. Another example of being very careful, when you ask a question, to make sure you explain why you are asking this question. Otherwise you&#39;ll get some answers you didn&#39;t expect, such as &quot;why would anyone ever do that?&quot;  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered one listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Joe Hopkins</strong>: &quot;What have you found to be the most limiting or annoying part of the ASP.NET MVC? And do you have details on the <a href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software</a> 2009 conference?&quot;</li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the 37th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the expansion of Stack Overflow into non-programming IT topics, the pernicious problem of &quot;systemitis&quot;, and how to reach the next generation of programmers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 37th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the expansion of Stack Overflow into non-programming IT topics, the pernicious problem of &quot;systemitis&quot;, and how to reach the next generation of programmers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I was star-struck that Alan Kay actually <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-our-newest-member-alan-kay/">participated in Stack Overflow</a>, both answering a question and even asking a question of his own.  </p></li>
<li><p>We finally <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/wmd-editor-reverse-engineered/">reverse engineered the WMD source code</a>, thanks to the noble and herculean efforts of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3161/dana">Dana Robinson</a>. If you&#39;re interested you can pull the latest version from <a href="http://github.com/derobins/wmd/tree/master">Dana&#39;s Git repository</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel recommends Eric Raymond&#39;s <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/version-control/version-control.html">Understanding Version-Control Systems</a>. Our (very, very limited) experience with Git emphasizes the importance of editing code with the goal of creating easy to apply patches. If your changes are hard to merge, they&#39;re likely to be ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve been having fun (for particularly small values of fun) <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-server-glamour-shots/">configuring and building the new server hardware</a> for Stack Overflow. I was moderately surprised to find that live rebuilding a RAID array with a 500 GB drive takes around 8 hours; rebuilding a simple 1-1 mirror array in offline mode takes 4 hours.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel recommends the built in <a href="http://edge.technet.com/Media/Network-Load-Balancing-NLB-in-Windows-Server-2008/">Windows Server Network Load Balancer (nlb)</a>; there&#39;s also the open source equivalent, <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a>, which the Reddit guys mentioned in our podcast with them.</p></li>
<li><p>We are planning to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/coming-in-march-it-stack-overflow/">launch an IT-centric Stack Overflow</a> in the next few months. This will be a place for System Administrator and IT professionals -- people who work with computers in a professional capacity, but aren&#39;t necessarily programmers -- can go to get their questions answered.</p></li>
<li><p>Our first challenge with the IT-centric Stack Overflow is naming it. Naming is extremely difficult, whether you&#39;re naming functions/variables, businesses, websites, or new human beings. We also need to find the leaders and moderators who will drive the community and set the tone for everyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel heard the world population of computer programmers is 4 million. I <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/725904.html">can&#39;t find a source</a> for this; does anyone have one?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel thinks the current downturn is unlikely to affect the tech sector, except possibly as a broad excuse to cut dead wood out of companies. It&#39;s interesting to contrast the Web 1.0 crash in 2000-2001 with the current environment; it certainly doesn&#39;t feel the same to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I don&#39;t agree with rigidly defined Project Manager, Programmer, and Test roles; how can you judge other people&#39;s competency in a particular discipline if you have zero competency in it yourself? Obviously this varies by company and person, but cross-training in related disciplines will make you a better programmer.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel talks about <strong>&quot;systemitis&quot;</strong>, programmers who spend the bulk of their time creating giant universal programming solutions to business problems that don&#39;t really make sense. This is perhaps a sign of programmers who aren&#39;t being challenged in their jobs. Rather than letting them spend their time creating another Universal System, try to recognize systemitis, and encourage these programmers to improve their skills in related disciplines instead of building &quot;the system&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>We remember the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001104.html">classic BASIC programming</a> that a whole generation of programmers <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000414.html">grew up with</a>. Typing in and modifying these simple little games was our first programming experience, an experience that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000936.html">launched a lifelong career</a>. What is the equivalent for today&#39;s young programmers?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Joel</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432922/significant-new-inventions-in-computing-since-1980">Significant new inventions in computing since 1980?</a> Joel picked Alan Kay&#39;s question, even before Joel knew it was from Alan Kay. We swear!<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered several listener question on this podcast:</p>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 37th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the expansion of Stack Overflow into non-programming IT topics, the pernicious problem of "systemitis", and how to reach the next generation of programmers.


I was star-struck that Alan Kay actually participated in Stack Overflow, both answering a question and even asking a question of his own.  
We finally reverse engineered the WMD source code, thanks to the noble and herculean efforts of Dana Robinson. If you're interested you can pull the latest version from Dana's Git repository.
Joel recommends Eric Raymond's Understanding Version-Control Systems. Our (very, very limited) experience with Git emphasizes the importance of editing code with the goal of creating easy to apply patches. If your changes are hard to merge, they're likely to be ignored.
I've been having fun (for particularly small values of fun) configuring and building the new server hardware for Stack Overflow. I was moderately surprised to find that live rebuilding a RAID array with a 500 GB drive takes around 8 hours; rebuilding a simple 1-1 mirror array in offline mode takes 4 hours.  
Joel recommends the built in Windows Server Network Load Balancer (nlb); there's also the open source equivalent, HAProxy, which the Reddit guys mentioned in our podcast with them.
We are planning to launch an IT-centric Stack Overflow in the next few months. This will be a place for System Administrator and IT professionals -- people who work with computers in a professional capacity, but aren't necessarily programmers -- can go to get their questions answered.
Our first challenge with the IT-centric Stack Overflow is naming it. Naming is extremely difficult, whether you're naming functions/variables, businesses, websites, or new human beings. We also need to find the leaders and moderators who will drive the community and set the tone for everyone else.
Joel heard the world population of computer programmers is 4 million. I can't find a source for this; does anyone have one?
Joel thinks the current downturn is unlikely to affect the tech sector, except possibly as a broad excuse to cut dead wood out of companies. It's interesting to contrast the Web 1.0 crash in 2000-2001 with the current environment; it certainly doesn't feel the same to us.
Joel and I don't agree with rigidly defined Project Manager, Programmer, and Test roles; how can you judge other people's competency in a particular discipline if you have zero competency in it yourself? Obviously this varies by company and person, but cross-training in related disciplines will make you a better programmer.
Joel talks about "systemitis", programmers who spend the bulk of their time creating giant universal programming solutions to business problems that don't really make sense. This is perhaps a sign of programmers who aren't being challenged in their jobs. Rather than letting them spend their time creating another Universal System, try to recognize systemitis, and encourage these programmers to improve their skills in related disciplines instead of building "the system"
We remember the classic BASIC programming that a whole generation of programmers grew up with. Typing in and modifying these simple little games was our first programming experience, an experience that launched a lifelong career. What is the equivalent for today's young programmers?


Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:


Joel: Significant new inventions in computing since 1980? Joel picked Alan Kay's question, even before Joel knew it was from Alan Kay. We swear!


We answered several listener question on this podcast:


Alfred: "What will happen to the open source movement in a sluggish economy? Will it grow or shrink?"
Shawn: "On the Business of Software: why do companies sell only small personal pizzas instead of individual pizza slices?"
Daniel: "Large companies have well-defined roles like PM, Dev, and Test that are quite rigid. Is this a good s...]]></itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Jeff, with special guest Eric Sink of SourceGear, discuss source control present and future, why writing a compiler is an important rite of passage for programmers, and how budding software engineers should be educated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I was convinced Eric was going to agree with me on whether or not software developers should know C. Unfortunately for me, <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">he agrees with Joel</a>. Doh!</p></li>
<li><p>Eric&#39;s <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html">Source Control HOWTO</a> should be required reading for every software developer. Eric literally wrote the book on this, and in fact this series is being converted into a book. Deservedly so; it&#39;s fantastic. The best person to explain source control is someone like Eric who literally wrote a source control system from scratch -- <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>An extended discussion of the evolution of source control systems, into distributed version control (DVCS) such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a>, <a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a>, and <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>. Eric feels Linus Torvalds&#39; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">video &quot;evangelizing&quot; Git</a> does the opposite for many. He&#39;s also uneasy about branching and merging becoming easy, common operations, which is much of the promise of DVCS.</p></li>
<li><p>Eric feels DVCS solves certain edge conditions very well, but those edge conditions should only be explored when you feel the need, not promoted as broad feature bullets to the average developer. &quot;The harder you try to explain DVCS, the worse it gets, so stop!&quot;  </p></li>
<li><p>Eric points to Eric Raymond&#39;s evolving <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/version-control/version-control.html">Understanding Version-Control Systems</a> as a pretty good survey of today&#39;s source control landscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Often, features aren&#39;t the point -- discoverability is. I was amused to find that <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/java_eclipse_3.html">Eric discovered how convenient background compilation is in Eclipse</a>. This is something that Visual Basic developers have had for 8 years! Java and C# developers don&#39;t appreciate what they&#39;re missing because it hasn&#39;t been surfaced in the product, until now.</p></li>
<li><p>Eric and Joel note that, at some level, source control is about putting obstacles (let&#39;s call them safety barriers) in front of developers -- and the question is, how many does your shop need? Do you remember working without version control at all? It&#39;s incredibly fast, until stuff gets overwritten or lost, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and Eric maintain that writing a compiler is an important rite of passage for a programmer. There&#39;s an enormous class of programming problems where writing a lexer, parser, recursive descent, and parse trees will help you. Once you understand how easy it is to set up a state machine, you&#39;ll never try to use a regular expression inappropriately ever again.</p></li>
<li><p>Eric also <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html">wrote a web browser</a>. It&#39;s interesting to contrast the experience of writing a compiler, which is typically extremely strict and will fail to compile if a single character is out of place, versus writing a web browser, which accepts all kinds of malformed and downright incorrect HTML and JavaScript. Eric and Joel think this was categorically a huge mistake; I&#39;m <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000848.html">not so sure</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel%27s_law">Postel&#39;s robustness principle</a>: &quot;be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept.&quot; This becomes a painful war of attrition at some level; everybody is vying to accept <em>just a little bit</em> liberally than the next guy, so isn&#39;t there an implied element of mutually assured destruction at the end?</p></li>
<li><p>Eric: &quot;Computer Science degrees do not teach programming; they teach how to learn&quot;. And he&#39;s OK with that. We all agree that it&#39;s hugely important to complement your computer science curriculum with either hobby projects, internships in the so-called &quot;real world&quot; -- or both!</p></li>
<li><p>Congratulations to our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/new-uservoice-moderator/">new UserVoice community moderators</a> -- Joel Coehoorn and Sean Massa. Do participate on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/">Stack Overflow UserVoice feedback site</a>, we check it every day, and we read all the feedback we get!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eric</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/76364/what-is-the-single-most-effective-thing-you-did-to-improve-your-programming-skill">What is the single most effective thing you did to improve your programming skills?</a> Eric says it was when he wrote a compiler. &quot;You&#39;ll write the crappiest compiler ever, but you will learn so much.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeff</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406760/whats-your-most-controversial-programming-opinion">What&#39;s your most controversial programming opinion</a>? This question is almost a textbook example of what we <em>don&#39;t</em> want on Stack Overflow, in that it&#39;s an unanswerable and probably contentious discussion. And yet it&#39;s an extraordinarily high quality question! This is a testament to the quality of the participants, another example of the Stack Overflow community defining what they want to see and setting a positive example for other programmers to follow.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered one listener question on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Espen Grindhaug</strong>: &quot;In many universities and colleges, they don&#39;t teach the &#39;new&#39; technologies. Can you list some books to get up to speed on the new technologies?&quot;</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 34th episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel recommends <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4211693">a pink HDMI cable</a> as a christmas gift for the special ladies in your life. This will go nicely with her pink ethernet cable, pink USB cable..   </p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve placed an order for our dedicated servers and have found a dedicated host we tentatively like. We&#39;ll be exploring the &quot;buy&quot; axis of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/server-hosting-rent-vs-buy/">build vs. buy</a> because it gives us greater power and control over our setup. This will also be my first time building a RAID 10 array, which is supposedly a <a href="http://www.miracleas.com/BAARF/RAID5_versus_RAID10.txt">far better solution than RAID 5</a>, and I&#39;m geeking out a bit over that.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel remembers George Orwell&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/">The Thin Red Line</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s advisable for programmers to spend some time rotating through customer support so they can <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001013.html">lean to share the customer&#39;s pain</a>. Alternately, Joel has an even better idea: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/UsabilityTestingwithMorae.html">perform usability tests periodically</a>, with your developers observing. Developers sometimes come up with great new features when exposed to actual users working with the software.  </p></li>
<li><p>The Fog Creek Team completed the Endless Setlist on hard in Rock Band 2. That&#39;s 84 songs in a row, mightily impressive, at least to me.</p></li>
<li><p>I have mixed feelings about easter eggs; if you&#39;re going to put something cool and hidden in your product, why not make it a standard feature so most people will find it and benefit from it? There are two discussions of easter eggs on Stack Overflow: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/140376/what-easter-eggs-have-you-placed-in-code">What Easter Eggs have you placed in code</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4943/is-it-a-good-idea-to-put-easter-eggs-in-applications">Is it a good idea to put Easter Eggs in applications?</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>You could argue that a lot of modern large application features are effectively easter eggs because people can&#39;t find them! This is what motivated the move to the Ribbon UI in Office 2007. Nine out of ten feature requests for Office were <em>already in the product</em>. That&#39;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/softwarereviews/news/2007/01/72596">the ultimate easter egg</a>, and not in a good way.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed Stack Overflow question bounty feature -- to help get those persistently unanswered questions some new attention -- has two gating clauses: first, you can only attach a small reputation bounty after 24 hours; second, the majority of the bounty will come from the asker&#39;s own reputation. You have to be willing to slice off a part of your own rep as a reward.</p></li>
<li><p>We noticed that Jason Calacanis of Mahalo will be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/story?id=6464889&amp;page=1">doing a Q&amp;A site</a>. The difference is that this site will pay answerers in real money, part of what Joel calls Jason&#39;s Econ 101 management style. The danger is that financial incentives can destroy intrinsic motivation. What&#39;s your management style? <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08.html">Command and Control</a>, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html">Econ 101</a>, or <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10.html">Identity</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>There is a whole new generation of programmers growing up with code like we did. Here&#39;s hoping they&#39;re learning from our mistakes, so they can make all new mistakes and not repeat all the same dumb mistakes we made. It&#39;s almost like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000446.html">a system of software apprenticeship</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is code elegance in the eye of the beholder? Consider the two answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/337704/parameterizing-a-sql-in-clause">Parameterizing a SQL IN Clause</a> -- which one is more elegant, and why?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jeff</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327973/how-old-are-you-and-how-old-were-you-when-you-started-coding">How old are you, and how old were you when you started coding?</a> This is a great example of using of Stack Overflow to do cool stuff we didn&#39;t anticipate. It also broke our <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24066/what-formula-should-be-used-to-determine-hot-questions">hot question algorithm</a> pretty badly, because it had such a huge number of responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joel</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/343390/what-was-your-biggest-cs-eye-opener">What was your biggest CS eye opener?</a> Joel points to K&amp;R&#39;s observation that a[5] and 5[a] are the same thing.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/337704/parameterizing-a-sql-in-clause">Parameterizing a SQL IN Clause</a>. Great example of my accepted answer not being accepted by the community. I just wanted to highlight the cleverness of Joel&#39;s solution, which I literally would never have thought of. I ended up using the community&#39;s solution, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Chris</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s often said that the job of the software development manager&#39;s job is to insulate developers from customers. But I&#39;ve found it&#39;s helpful for developers to have interactions with users and stakeholders.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sinbad Carver</strong>: &quot;Did you leave any easter eggs in Stack Overflow? If not, did you consider any?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Derek in Canada</strong>: &quot;If you attach a bounty to some questions, will that lead to less people answering regular questions?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#39;d like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to <a href="mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com">podcast@stackoverflow.com</a>. You can <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/recording-podcast-questions-using-your-telephone/">record a question</a> using nothing but a telephone and a web browser.

The Fog Creek Team completed the Endless Setlist on hard in Rock Band 2. That's 84 songs in a row, mightily impressive, at least to me.

<ul>
<li><p>I gifted the Fog Creek office with <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/11/05/fake-plastic-cymbals/">a set of cymbals for the Rock Band 2 drums</a>, to complement the <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/03/31/equipping-your-first-fake-plastic-rock-band/">sweet Rock Band setup</a> I bought for them earlier this year. And yes, I already got them <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/11/21/the-ultimate-vocalist-battlestation/">a tambourine and cowbell</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re starting to seriously consider <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/server-hosting-rent-vs-buy/">buying our own servers and renting rackspace</a> for the Stack Overflow servers. It makes sense to us from both from a financial standpoint and from a performance standpoint. We&#39;re also considering some of the cloud services like Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure.</p></li>
<li><p>We wonder why so much of the software that&#39;s bundled with hardware is so terrible. There&#39;s nothing scarier to me as a software developer than the DVD labelled &quot;Install me!&quot; provided with some bit of hardware that I just bought. Why is that?  </p></li>
<li><p>I tend to agree that one danger sign for a new programming job is the requirement to be on call. This is a bit more normal for sysadmin positions, but it&#39;s unusual (and arguably unhealthy) for programmers.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I note that developing software predisposes you to &quot;debug&quot; real world processes that largely aren&#39;t worth the effort. Beware!  </p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve probably mentioned this before, but whatever else you decide to do with your database, it is incredibly important that you <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001050.html">get your database under version control</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Does it make sense for every software developer to start their own company, which is what <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">Paul Graham seems to advocate</a>? It&#39;s certainly one of the few paths to becoming very wealthy, if that&#39;s your primary goal.</p></li>
<li><p>If you just can&#39;t get enough Spolsky, Joel was featured on the <a href="http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/">Startup Success podcast</a> with Bob Walsh and Patrick Foley.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jeff</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/136443/why-doesnt-ie7-copy-precode-blocks-to-the-clipboard-correctly">Why doesn&#39;t IE7 copy PRE CODE blocks to the clipboard correctly?</a> This is sort of cheating because it&#39;s my own question, but it&#39;s a perfect example of using Stack Overflow to build Stack Overflow! We are the target audience, too. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joel</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242996/dealbreakers-for-new-programming-jobs">Dealbreakers for new programming jobs</a>. Some great responses to this question; worth a read if you&#39;re looking for a new job.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Babak</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/164432/what-real-life-bad-habits-has-programming-given-you">What real life bad habits has programming given you?</a> We alluded to this question in the previous podcast; it&#39;s a classic.  </p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the 2<sup>5</sup> episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss software piracy, dealing with public criticism, how to get people to answer your questions, and the ideal programmer office.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A brief digression about the analog to digital television switch. Make sure you watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTSS8E7bKXg">this brief instructional video</a> so you&#39;re prepared.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel gives an overview of Fog Creek&#39;s attitude towards software piracy and licensing. At its root, we believe that buying your software has to be easier than stealing it. Stop thinking of it as fighting an enemy and think of it as simply being better than the alternative.  </p></li>
<li><p>On advertising: if you can get people to talk about or willingly watch your ad, you&#39;ve already won. This is why <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/mojave-experiment-bad-science-bad.html">Wil Shipley&#39;s rant about the Mojave Experiment</a> is counter-productive.</p></li>
<li><p>I argue that Apple is making real headway in mainstream marketshare, largely because they&#39;ve won the advertising war so decisively. Joel argues that they haven&#39;t. Which of us is right?</p></li>
<li><p>One of our major performance optimizations for the &quot;related questions&quot; query is removing the top 10,000 most common English dictionary words (as determined by Google search) before submitting the query to the SQL Server 2008 full text engine. It&#39;s shocking how little is left of most posts once you remove the top 10k English dictionary words. This helps limit and narrow the returned results, which makes the query dramatically faster.  </p></li>
<li><p>Congratulations to Stack Overflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">team member</a> Geoff Dalgas; he&#39;s the proud father of a new baby boy as of last week!   </p></li>
<li><p>We plan to mail out weekly email summaries of other people&#39;s answers and comments to your posts -- much like <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> -- for people who haven&#39;t visited Stack Overflow in a week or longer.</p></li>
<li><p>Some topics are just fundamentally hard to understand, like <a href="http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/21-and-the-monty-hall-paradox">the Monty Hall Problem</a>, and lead to a lot of extra discussion. The <a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/09/09/the-goddamn-airplane-on-the-goddamn-treadmill/">two banned topics</a> on the XKCD forums are 0.9999 = 1 and airplane on a treadmill for that reason.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel &quot;doesn&#39;t want to get too inspirational and stuff&quot; but if you&#39;re not doing a few things where you&#39;re failing a little, you&#39;re probably not trying hard enough. I say if everyone likes you, you probably aren&#39;t doing anything interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel points to <a href="http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/writing.html">Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper</a>: &quot;pretend that your reader is <em>lazy, stupid,</em> and <em>mean.&quot;</em> And the converse, as a reader, is to try to infer the most charitable possible interpretation of what you&#39;re reading. Not that anyone actually does this, in my experience.  </p></li>
<li><p>Can you tell the difference between people who honestly want to have a discussion about a topic, and people who are using that topic as a prop for their ego? Learning to make this distinction can ultimately save you a lot of time.</p></li>
<li><p>My favorite Stack Overflow question this week is a classic, one of my early favorites: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26049/how-to-get-attention-for-your-old-unanswered-questions">How to get attention for your old, unanswered questions</a>. The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26049/how-to-get-attention-for-your-old-unanswered-questions#28310">response by icelava</a> is absolutely on target -- if you want people to pay attention to your question, <em>you</em> have to pay attention to your question. Provide status and progress reports from your own continued effort to answer the question yourself. An excellent example of this is lassevik&#39;s tenacious return to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56655/arithmetic-underflow-or-overflow-exception-during-debugging">his oddball problem</a> which ultimately turned out to be a bug in the video driver, not his code!</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s favorite Stack Overflow question this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306708/must-haves-for-developers-office">Must haves for a developer&#39;s office</a>. Hard to disagree with the community on this one: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001146.html">a quality chair</a>, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001076.html">two large monitors</a>, whiteboards, and control of the lighting. If possible -- and this is usually a hard thing to get, so you have to really consider how realistic a negotiating position asking for your own private office is. That said, Joel and I continue to believe having a private office is the most ideal programming environment; it offers choice between open/noisy and closed/private. This also depends how much noise you can tolerate. In any case, demand your <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html">Programmer&#39;s Bill of Rights</a>. As Joel says, &quot;it&#39;s only money&quot;.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>David Ackerman</strong>: &quot;As a recent graduate, I&#39;ve been on a lot of interview trips recently. The interviews that didn&#39;t result in offers have hurt my confidence more than expected. Jeff, you get a lot of flak on your blog, how do you stay positive when people are tearing you apart?&quot;<br></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the 25 episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff discuss software piracy, dealing with public criticism, how to get people to answer your questions, and the ideal programmer office.


A brief digression about the analog to digital television switch. Make sure you watch this brief instructional video so you're prepared.
Joel gives an overview of Fog Creek's attitude towards software piracy and licensing. At its root, we believe that buying your software has to be easier than stealing it. Stop thinking of it as fighting an enemy and think of it as simply being better than the alternative.  
On advertising: if you can get people to talk about or willingly watch your ad, you've already won. This is why Wil Shipley's rant about the Mojave Experiment is counter-productive.
I argue that Apple is making real headway in mainstream marketshare, largely because they've won the advertising war so decisively. Joel argues that they haven't. Which of us is right?
One of our major performance optimizations for the "related questions" query is removing the top 10,000 most common English dictionary words (as determined by Google search) before submitting the query to the SQL Server 2008 full text engine. It's shocking how little is left of most posts once you remove the top 10k English dictionary words. This helps limit and narrow the returned results, which makes the query dramatically faster.  
Congratulations to Stack Overflow team member Geoff Dalgas; he's the proud father of a new baby boy as of last week!   
We plan to mail out weekly email summaries of other people's answers and comments to your posts -- much like FriendFeed -- for people who haven't visited Stack Overflow in a week or longer.
Some topics are just fundamentally hard to understand, like the Monty Hall Problem, and lead to a lot of extra discussion. The two banned topics on the XKCD forums are 0.9999 = 1 and airplane on a treadmill for that reason.  
Joel "doesn't want to get too inspirational and stuff" but if you're not doing a few things where you're failing a little, you're probably not trying hard enough. I say if everyone likes you, you probably aren't doing anything interesting.
Joel points to Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper: "pretend that your reader is lazy, stupid, and mean." And the converse, as a reader, is to try to infer the most charitable possible interpretation of what you're reading. Not that anyone actually does this, in my experience.  
Can you tell the difference between people who honestly want to have a discussion about a topic, and people who are using that topic as a prop for their ego? Learning to make this distinction can ultimately save you a lot of time.
My favorite Stack Overflow question this week is a classic, one of my early favorites: How to get attention for your old, unanswered questions. The response by icelava is absolutely on target -- if you want people to pay attention to your question, you have to pay attention to your question. Provide status and progress reports from your own continued effort to answer the question yourself. An excellent example of this is lassevik's tenacious return to his oddball problem which ultimately turned out to be a bug in the video driver, not his code!
Joel's favorite Stack Overflow question this week is Must haves for a developer's office. Hard to disagree with the community on this one: a quality chair, two large monitors, whiteboards, and control of the lighting. If possible -- and this is usually a hard thing to get, so you have to really consider how realistic a negotiating position asking for your own private office is. That said, Joel and I continue to believe having a private office is the most ideal programming environment; it offers choice between open/noisy and closed/private. This also depends how much noise you can tolerate. In any case, demand your Programmer's Bill of Rights. As Joel says, "it's only money".

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the thirty-first episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where
Joel and Jeff discuss.. stuff!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Based on some <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/podcast-30/#comments">comments from Podcast #30</a>, we now know that &quot;Learning about NP-Completeness from Jeff is like learning about irony from Alanis Morissette&quot;. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001187.html">It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true!</a></p></li>
<li><p>It was also noted that &quot;[Jeff] certainly no mathematician.&quot; In my defense, I&#39;ve always been very open about my lack of math skills. It&#39;s even item #3 in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000770.html">my Five Things We Didn&#39;t Know About You list</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed that someone <a href="http://www.getacoder.com/projects/bug_finder_92913.html">posted the halting problem to GetACoder.com</a>, so if nothing else good came of this, at least humor was delivered.</p></li>
<li><p>How useful is math to most programmers? In other words, how often does a typical software developer use something they learned in, say, Calculus class or beyond? Joel cites the <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/7144/http:zSzzSzwww-db.stanford.eduzSz%7EbackrubzSzpageranksub.pdf/page98pagerank.pdf">original Google PageRank algorithm paper</a> (pdf) and <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">Google&#39;s MapReduce</a> (pdf) as good examples of math in practice for mainstream programming.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe it&#39;s important for programmers to develop skills that aren&#39;t programming, necessarily, but that are complementary to programming, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000849.html">such as graphic design</a>. (Or databases, or HTML/CSS, etcetera) Remember, good programmers write code; great programmers <em>steal</em> code. This applies triply to design.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I both believe that status reports should be treated as a &quot;public wall&quot;, never as weapons to determine how people get paid or promoted. The single best thing I&#39;ve ever read on this is <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/pdfs/Compensation.pdf">Poppendieck&#39;s Team Compensation</a> (pdf) -- which I discovered through Joel&#39;s first collection of software writing. If I could, I&#39;d print out a copy of this and staple it to the face of every person in the world who manages software developers. Yes, it really is that good. Go read it!</p></li>
<li><p>One team at Fog Creek instituted a daily standup meeting for their project, which is a staple of most agile development approaches. In addition to the &quot;Daily Kiwi&quot; convention, Fog Creek also use a locally hosted instance of <a href="http://laconi.ca/">Laconica</a>, an open source <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> clone. It&#39;s certainly an interesting <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001191.html">alternative to email</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel believes most small to midsize software companies will deal with an economic downturn by (temporarily) deferring development of new versions of their products. For companies that have a lot of &quot;extra&quot; staff, the economy might be an excuse to get rid of the worst performing 10% of your employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel justifies having a nice office space as 1) a recruiting tool 2) enabling higher programmer productivity and 3) the cost of a nice office space is a tiny number relative to all your other expenses running a company. I argue that companies which don&#39;t intuitively understand why nice office space is important to their employees who spend 8+ hours every day there.. well, those companies aren&#39;t smart enough to survive anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>My favorite Stack Overflow question this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306668/are-parameters-really-enough-to-prevent-sql-injections">Are Parameters really enough to prevent Sql injections</a>? Joel and I have a long discussion about the importance of parameterized SQL, both for performance and for security (beware <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">Little Bobby Tables</a>!). But you should know that it&#39;s not 100% foolproof; it is possible (though rare) to have latent SQL injection exploits even when fully parameterized.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s favorite Stack Overflow question this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273299/how-do-you-pull-yourself-out-of-a-programming-slump">How do you pull yourself out of a programming &#39;slump&#39;</a>? Joel knows tons of programmers who have burned out by age 50, and feels it is rare to find programmers who have written code for 20 to 30 years. Joel&#39;s article <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">Fire and Motion</a> and my article <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000176.html">Moving The Block</a> sort of cover this topic. Joel also recommends the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/013143635X/?tag=codinghorror-20">Death March</a> as a reference book for what to avoid.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions in this episode:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mike Akers</strong>: &quot;How much time should programmers be spending in Photoshop?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David from the UK</strong>: &quot;How do you handle status reports at Fog Creek?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matthew Glidden</strong>: &quot;How do you run a software company in lean economic times?&quot;</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Richard worked as the user interface guy on calendar startup <a href="http://www.kiko.com/">Kiko.com</a>; UserVoice was originally inspired by Richard&#39;s work on Kiko, as a hybrid of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some thematic similarities between <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/">Dell&#39;s IdeaStorm</a> and <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaHome">My Starbucks Idea</a> and UserVoice -- to some degree, UserVoice is users voting on the direction your software should take. Does software democracy work?</p></li>
<li><p>UserVoice isn&#39;t just for software -- there&#39;s also <a href="http://obamacto.uservoice.com/">Obama CTO</a> and <a href="http://rebuildtheparty.uservoice.com">Rebuild The Party</a>. This generated huge load and traffic, so if nothing else it was a good scaling test. The usual item has a maximum of 50 comments; one suggestion had 980 comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Our use of UserVoice is a bit anomalous; I prefer to (politely) decline requests that I think we won&#39;t get to. Is it more honest to let <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/KDente/archive/2005/03/13/394499.aspx">reasonable requests like this one</a> languish in the system for literally years, ala Microsoft&#39;s Connect, then to find out that they&#39;ve been set to &quot;wontfix&quot; after 3 years? As a user myself, I find this behavior abhorrent.</p></li>
<li><p>We do plan to talk a bit less about building Stack Overflow and a bit more about our favorite questions on Stack Overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s favorite Stack Overflow question this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/297037/what-tricks-do-you-use-to-get-yourself-in-the-zone">What Tricks Do You Use to Get Yourself &quot;In The Zone&quot;?</a></p></li>
<li><p>UserVoice is a Ruby on Rails app, with approximately 6,000 lines of code. A large portion of that is unit tests.  </p></li>
<li><p>Jeff&#39;s favorite Stack Overflow question is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210829/what-is-an-np-complete-problem">What is an NP-Complete Problem</a>. This is a followup to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001187.html">the blog post</a> where I demonstrate a sadly incomplete understanding of the concept of being NP-complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel notes that there are harder problems than NP-Complete, namely the halting problem. There&#39;s a great Stack Overflow question on this, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/235984/the-halting-problem-in-the-field">The Halting Problem in the Field</a></p></li>
<li><p>There are a lot of very hard problems in computer software that aren&#39;t necessarily NP-complete -- and we&#39;ve had limited success &quot;solving&quot; them, such as speech and voice recognition. Furthermore, if the best algorithm we can come up with is something like n-cubed, is that a realistic solution?</p></li>
<li><p>UserVoice will be using Jan Rain&#39;s <a href="https://rpxnow.com/">RpxNow</a> to implement OpenID. We wondered how <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myopenid.com</a> would make money; their RpxNow service is the answer to that question.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-ninth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The downside of being a PC gamer: it&#39;s prime game release season. My productivity last week was nil due to the release of Fallout 3, as I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001185.html">discuss on my blog</a>. But it was totally worth it.  </p></li>
<li><p>One videogame cliche is the levels filled with random barrels and crates as filler. The classic game site Old Man Murray used to rate games on <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/40.html">how quickly you saw a crate after starting the game</a>. And then there was the Quake 2 mod where you played as a crate .. in a room full of crates! Surreal.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve always wondered if Joel was a gamer. Apparently he played Call of Duty 3 and 4, which bring him back to his days as an Israeli Army infantryman. Also, Bioshock, which is outstanding. At least he has good taste. </p></li>
<li><p>Joel wonders why we don&#39;t use Google search as the primary search method on Stack Overflow. Of course it is possible to search Stack Overflow with Google using the &quot;site:&quot; specifier, as long as you scope to an appropriate &quot;folder&quot;. Currently we offer Google as a search alternative when no results are found. I still think both search methods are desirable, because we can search by user, by tag, and so forth.</p></li>
<li><p>My first organic hit on Stack Overflow based on a coding search was this question about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/118654/iron-python-beautiful-soup-win32-app">using Beautiful Soup in IronPython under C#</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One of Joel&#39;s favorite Stack Overflow questions this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/202723/coding-in-other-spoken-languages">Coding In Other Spoken Languages</a>. The discussion is great, but it does beg the question -- as much time and money as companies spend localizing software, why don&#39;t we localize programming languages? Joel points out that the Excel macro language is perhaps an exception, as the function names are localized. This is quite rare, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages">there are non-English based programming languages</a> out there.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel has literally written the book on hiring great programmers -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1590598385/?tag=codinghorror-20">Smart and Gets Things Done</a>. In this podcast he examines a few guidelines from the Fog Creek hiring practices. One of those is having <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/jobs/summerintern.html">an intern program that is second to none</a>. I was definitely impressed when I visited. Did I mention that they have fully catered lunches every weekday? Also, don&#39;t forget that the interview process is your opportunity to judge the company that wants to hire you. If they don&#39;t have a good interview process, do you really want to work there?</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of information you are faced with as a developer is overwhelming, with more new stuff arriving every day. How do you keep up with information overload? <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000575.html">I recommend &quot;Just In Time&quot; learning</a>. Joel highlights the difference between the early days of Java and today, now that Java has grown into something of a monster. Is .NET on the same path?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Jonas from Sweden</strong>: &quot;Can you expand on what characteristics a good programmer should have? When hiring, how do I get them to tell me what makes them a good programmer?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Idriss Selhoum</strong>: &quot;How do you feel about Microsoft releasing new .NET versions so rapidly, and fragmenting the developer base?&quot;</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the twenty-ninth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:


The downside of being a PC gamer: it's prime game release season. My productivity last week was nil due to the release of Fallout 3, as I discuss on my blog. But it was totally worth it.  
One videogame cliche is the levels filled with random barrels and crates as filler. The classic game site Old Man Murray used to rate games on how quickly you saw a crate after starting the game. And then there was the Quake 2 mod where you played as a crate .. in a room full of crates! Surreal.
I've always wondered if Joel was a gamer. Apparently he played Call of Duty 3 and 4, which bring him back to his days as an Israeli Army infantryman. Also, Bioshock, which is outstanding. At least he has good taste. 
Joel wonders why we don't use Google search as the primary search method on Stack Overflow. Of course it is possible to search Stack Overflow with Google using the "site:" specifier, as long as you scope to an appropriate "folder". Currently we offer Google as a search alternative when no results are found. I still think both search methods are desirable, because we can search by user, by tag, and so forth.
My first organic hit on Stack Overflow based on a coding search was this question about using Beautiful Soup in IronPython under C#.
One of Joel's favorite Stack Overflow questions this week is Coding In Other Spoken Languages. The discussion is great, but it does beg the question -- as much time and money as companies spend localizing software, why don't we localize programming languages? Joel points out that the Excel macro language is perhaps an exception, as the function names are localized. This is quite rare, but there are non-English based programming languages out there.
Joel has literally written the book on hiring great programmers -- Smart and Gets Things Done. In this podcast he examines a few guidelines from the Fog Creek hiring practices. One of those is having an intern program that is second to none. I was definitely impressed when I visited. Did I mention that they have fully catered lunches every weekday? Also, don't forget that the interview process is your opportunity to judge the company that wants to hire you. If they don't have a good interview process, do you really want to work there?
The amount of information you are faced with as a developer is overwhelming, with more new stuff arriving every day. How do you keep up with information overload? I recommend "Just In Time" learning. Joel highlights the difference between the early days of Java and today, now that Java has grown into something of a monster. Is .NET on the same path?  


We also answered the following listener questions:


Jonas from Sweden: "Can you expand on what characteristics a good programmer should have? When hiring, how do I get them to tell me what makes them a good programmer?"
Idriss Selhoum: "How do you feel about Microsoft releasing new .NET versions so rapidly, and fragmenting the developer base?"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-eighth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where
Joel and Jeff discuss Windows Azure, SQL Server 2008 full text search, Bayesian filtering, porn detection, and project management -- among other things. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff met the inestimable <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/">Joey DeVilla aka Accordion Guy</a> at PDC, who challenged him to pronounce Azure as in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/windowsazure.mspx">&quot;Windows Azure&quot;</a>. My pronunciation reference for Azure is entirely based on the word appearing in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/">A Clockwork Orange</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I greatly enjoyed Corey Trager&#39;s <a href="http://ifdefined.com/blog/post/2008/10/Jeff-Atwood-is-trying-to-kill-me.aspx">Jeff Atwood is Trying to Kill Me</a>. We do try to exploit the Jewish / Goyish dynamic. Also, Jeff is sorry he tried to kill you, but glad you survived to write that highly entertaining article.</p></li>
<li><p>We are still struggling with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/sql-2008-full-text-search-problems/">SQL Server 2008 full text search issues</a>. And yes, we have engaged with the SQL Server team on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s Inc. magazine article about Stack Overflow is now on newsstands (it&#39;s the issue with Kevin Rose of Digg on the cover). The article is also online as well: <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html">How Hard Could It Be? The Unproven Path</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We have worked closely with <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a>, who has singlehandedly took it upon himself to be our Stack Overflow database ninja. He&#39;s gone far, far beyond what I would ever expect a volunteer to do -- so we&#39;ve added him as an official member of our virtual team. And if you need SQL Server expertise, Brent is your man.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft finally fixed their bizarre position on hotfixes. Instead of the bad old days of mandatory phone calls and requests, you can simply <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/search/?adv=1">download the hotfix you need</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One limitation of Linq to SQL is that it does not support any SQL Server full text search predicates. Fortunately, we can freely intermix SQL strings and Linq syntax as much as we like.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel points out that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/17.html">Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses an if statement</a>. We worry that Microsoft doesn&#39;t adapt their software well enough to the wider internet world, as demonstrated by the radically differing approaches to spellcheck from both companies.</p></li>
<li><p>We aren&#39;t clear what the purpose of Microsoft&#39;s new &quot;Oslo&quot; or <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/457530/Exploring_Oslo_s_Modeling_Language_Promises">M modelling language</a>, announced at PDC, is. More domain specific languages? Every developer becomes a language designer? Why does that scare me a little?</p></li>
<li><p>Ray Ozzie made specific reference to &quot;architecture astronaut&quot; at PDC, which is extra humorous because Joel was referring to Ozzie <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">when he coined the term</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel remembers Hillel Cooperman, who used to be a star at Microsoft, but now works for <a href="http://www.jacksonfish.com/">Jackson Fish Market</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One Stack Overflow question we enjoyed this week: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/263380/showing-too-much-skin-detection-in-software">Showing too much &#39;skin&#39; detection in software</a>. The definitive debunking of this technique is from Dan of Dan&#39;s Data, who <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/pornsweeper.htm">reviewed PORNsweeper in 2000</a>. We don&#39;t believe the technical landscape has changed since then. Great discussion on Stack Overflow as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel refers to the famous 1994 memo from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sinofsky">Steve Sinofsky</a> -- <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/about/wired/">Cornell is WIRED!</a> Steve started as Bill Gates&#39; assistant, and now he&#39;s in charge of Windows 7 after shipping Office 2007.</p></li>
<li><p>Another Stack Overflow question we enjoyed this week: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/229257/what-do-project-managers-do-all-day">What do project managers do all day?</a> We&#39;re not sure why the owner keeps deleting this question, as we think the answers have a lot of value. Joel also has a lot to say on the general topic of project management.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff is at the Professional Developers&#39; Conference in Los Angeles. He co-presented a session with Phil Haack on <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asp.net%2Fmvc%2F&amp;ei=eRUJSdniKZKasAOxw7ibDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1FWlq5gZ1lBZOIcCgJoB9yLn9pA&amp;sig2=VpUa916wqqPdZdHr84K2Mg">ASP.NET MVC</a>, which you can <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/">view online</a> if you are so inclined. Also while at PDC, Jeff participated in a brief roundtable meeting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Ozzie">Ray Ozzie</a>, who had some completely unsolicited and very positive things to say about Stack Overflow!</p></li>
<li><p>If you didn&#39;t know, Joel was the genesis of one of the earliest branded reddits -- the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/joel/">Joel on Software reddit</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We discuss the Reddit <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit">switch from Lisp to Python</a>, and the way Reddit stored <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2006/12/15/never-store-passwords-in-a-database">raw user passwords in the database</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We use a weighting algorithm based on Reddit&#39;s when we <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24066/what-formula-should-be-used-to-determine-hot-questions">calculate &quot;hotness&quot; in Stack Overflow</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit, like us, ran for quite a while on a single server. Moving to a second server, splitting the database, provided solid gains for Reddit and is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/adde-a-second-server/">something we just did as well</a>. According to Steve, splitting off the database is easy -- making sure you can scale to multiple <em>application</em> web servers is the difficult part, because of shared state caching.</p></li>
<li><p>Steve is a big fan of <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> which is a single software load balancer in front of all ~20 Reddit servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit&#39;s first big partner is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/independent/">The Independent</a>, for branded content. Although there is also <a href="http://www.weheartgossip.com/">WeHeartGossip</a>. Joel and I feel these sorts of communities -- to be truly successful -- need personalities associated with them that are emblematic of the values and goals of that community.</p></li>
<li><p>We briefly discuss some of the protection mechanisms Reddit has in place to prevent abuse and spammers. Steve and Alexis have much more experience dealing with abusive users than we do. Per Steve, the Reddit mantra is &quot;anything goes&quot;, so they try to do as little as possible to inhibit users. We generally agree that the volume of badness is remarkably small. Most users behave responsibly -- and this isn&#39;t just an optimistic opinion, it&#39;s based on actual data. That&#39;s the good news!</p></li>
<li><p>Behold the power of the Reddit audience: <a href="http://www.redditall.com/2008/08/great-idea-reddit-crowbar-for-cernlhc.html">they may just have saved the world</a> by sending a crowbar to the CERN Hadron collider.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-sixth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff answer five listener questions, mostly about social software design. Warning: this podcast features cowbell. Really.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Christopher Leary</strong>: &quot;Any thoughts on the general design of karma and rep systems based on your experience building one for Stack Overflow?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Michael L Perry:</strong> &quot;What about a system where votes by people who have more reputation count more?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeff Metzner</strong>: &quot;If I post personal anecdotes as an answer to a question, is it reasonable for other users to edit that?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>Anonymous: *</em>&quot;Why can&#39;t we ask IT questions? What about a sister site like Stack Overflow but for IT questions?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Miles Dennis:</strong> &quot;For a cost-conscious startup, where do you see the balance between taking inexperienced staff that costs less, versus experienced staff that costs more?&quot;</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the twenty-sixth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff answer five listener questions, mostly about social software design. Warning: this podcast features cowbell. Really.


Christopher Leary: "Any thoughts on the general design of karma and rep systems based on your experience building one for Stack Overflow?"
Michael L Perry: "What about a system where votes by people who have more reputation count more?"
Jeff Metzner: "If I post personal anecdotes as an answer to a question, is it reasonable for other users to edit that?"
*Anonymous: *"Why can't we ask IT questions? What about a sister site like Stack Overflow but for IT questions?"
Miles Dennis: "For a cost-conscious startup, where do you see the balance between taking inexperienced staff that costs less, versus experienced staff that costs more?"


If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to podcast@stackoverflow.com. You can record a question
using nothing but a telephone and a web browser. We also have a
dedicated phone number you can call to leave audio questions at 646-826-3879.

<li><p>Steve proposes we use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show">Muppets Show</a> theme as our podcast theme song.

Steve proposes we use the Muppets Show theme as our podcast theme song. I'm more amenable to "The Touch" as featured in the Transformers the Movie from 1986.  
We ask how Google maintains its culture in the face of an army of new hires entering the company every month.
Steve is, to put it mildly, a language maven. He shares some of his perspectives on language aesthetics. Should languages be designed by committee, or by a benevolent dictator?
If Steve could teach every developer one thing, it wouldn't be how to type, or how to write -- but how to market.
Google has an infrastructure in place to support "mini-startups" within the company. Joel thinks all good startups must have ideas that sound terrible. YouTube is a great example, as is the Flip video recorder.
Being an entrepreneur often means spending a lot of your time not programming. This can be challenging for software engineers who love to code. Make sure you know what you're signing up for if you go this route.
Steve is a big believer in the Google experience, even though his last three projects have been cancelled "for business reasons". Instead of Joel's "Smart, and Gets Things Done", Steve proposes "Done, and Gets Things Smart."
How much does choosing the "right" programming language matter? Isn't the variance between programmers far more significant to the end result? On the other hand, the best programmers often tend to be fluent in multiple languages.
One way to drag the "one horse language" programmers into multiple languages is to support sublanguages within the same runtime, ala IronPython, IronRuby, Jython, and JRuby.
Steve is considering porting his game Wyvern to Android. He can't talk about his current full time project at Google, but he does fess up to owning it -- both from the business side and the engineering side. So if this time it's cancelled, we really know who to blame.  
Steve: "You can't write about anything interesting without making a bunch of people mad.", "Everything you say can be quoted out of context 500 years from now."
One of my very favorite Steve Yegge posts is You Should Write Blogs. Unfortunately, despite my cajoling, blogging just isn't for everyone. Too many brilliant programmers are virtually unknown because they have no footprint on the web. This is one of the reasons we created Stack Overflow -- to lower that participation barrier, at least a few millimeters.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-fourth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, a special roundtable discussion <strong>conducted in NYC at Joel&#39;s Fog Creek offices with the entire Stack Overflow team</strong>. That includes Jarrod Dixon, Geoff Dalgas, and Michael Pryor in addition to Joel and Jeff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We muse about <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/01/15/um-whoops/">the 7.5 million dollar Dreamhost billing error</a>. We admire the openness of Dreamhost, that they would be so up front about such a major gaffe on their blog.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a rule at Fog Creek which we at Stack Overflow also follow -- never ship on Friday.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion about responsible advertising; contrasting our ad deal with <a href="http://www.woot.com/">woot</a> and the <a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> sponsorship of podcasts. One sells a product we&#39;ve bought before and vouch for, the other sells DRM encumbered product.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael and Joel bring up the idea of mixing real world money and our reputation system. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll do this, but it&#39;s an interesting conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussing Geoff&#39;s cool <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/i-dont-give-a-damn-about-my-reputation/">JavaScript reputation graphing system</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The giant &quot;questions&quot; with 300 answers were putting a huge load on the server and on client browsers. We never anticipated this would happen. Jarrod&#39;s pagination feature was deployed last night. Pagination begins at 30 answers, which matches the current wiki community threshold. If your &quot;question&quot; gets to page two of the answers, it&#39;ll be paginated and converted to community mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Michael asks the eternal question -- why not support alternate login methods versus OpenID? I believe that OpenID is a bit of a chicken and egg problem at the moment, and we want to support a better future. We are open to partnering with another OpenID provider to provide a more seamless signup experience; <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/affiliate">myopenid supports this</a> and we&#39;ll try to get it in the queue.</p></li>
<li><p>We go around the table, discussing the short term future -- what&#39;s the #1 feature each of us wants to see in on Stack Overflow?</p></li>
<li><p>Michael draws a comparison between Stack Overflow and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. You get points on this site for solving algorithmic / mathematical problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it has been criticized, we continue to like the Stack Overflow design, which is largely thanks to <a href="http://www.jeremykratz.com/">Jeremy Kratz</a>. We feel providing solid layout and markup control makes our questions look great.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised with the SQL Server 2005 full-text search on Stack Overflow, but we agree with Joel that something like <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene.NET</a> would probably work better, as it operates at the logical &quot;page&quot; level instead of database record level. People don&#39;t think in terms of database records; they think in terms of web pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Geoff discusses how important <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">sitemap.xml</a> was for us. Unlike a blog, we didn&#39;t have stable, permanent links to questions. until we rolled out sitemap it was literally <em>impossible</em> to find questions using web search, even if you entered the exact word-for-word title. As <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/protocol.html">google says</a>, you should use sitemaps for &quot;any site where certain pages are only accessible via a search form&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>The Stack Overflow team will be in New York City from the 24th to the 28th. It&#39;s partly business, and partly a reward to our team for their hard work on the site. What are some cool geeky things for us to do in NYC?</p></li>

<li><p>The power of short informal code reviews in bridging the skill gap between beginning and expert software developers. Good developers think of this as self-preservation, because today&#39;s beginner code is tomorrow&#39;s code you&#39;ll have to maintain.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been a lot of requests for a packaged, customized version of Stack Overflow, but we have some reservations about the difficulty of delivering a packaged solution, and whether the current design will scale down to smaller private communities at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Should trusted users be allowed to close questions? Or should the community simply vote them down? I argue we need both of these methods; Joel feels we only need voting.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s ok to have some &quot;fun&quot; programming questions every now and then. It can&#39;t be a community if you don&#39;t stop every so often to have some (at least partially on topic) fun.</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-second episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stack Overflow is now a public beta. We went from about 2-5% CPU usage during the private beta to over 50% CPU usage, on an 8-CPU server! Some day one stats: 1,500 questions were asked, 6,000 answers provided, 1,700 comments added, there were 62,000 unique visitors and almost 700,000 page views. Miraculously, the server is still running and performance is still snappy.</p></li>
<li><p>It was tempting to keep a closed community, but Joel and I believe the real value here is in letting Google and other web search engines in, along with the hordes of everyday average programmers. We believe programmers are a smarter breed of user, and the low-friction question and answer format will be sustainable for the greater public community if is designed properly. Hopefully.  </p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the twenty-second episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:


Stack Overflow is now a public beta. We went from about 2-5% CPU usage during the private beta to over 50% CPU usage, on an 8-CPU server! Some day one stats: 1,500 questions were asked, 6,000 answers provided, 1,700 comments added, there were 62,000 unique visitors and almost 700,000 page views. Miraculously, the server is still running and performance is still snappy.
It was tempting to keep a closed community, but Joel and I believe the real value here is in letting Google and other web search engines in, along with the hordes of everyday average programmers. We believe programmers are a smarter breed of user, and the low-friction question and answer format will be sustainable for the greater public community if is designed properly. Hopefully.  
We sit down with Josh Millard of MetaFilter, who graciously agreed at very short notice to come on and talk about his role as one of the 5 member core team that helps run and maintain MetaFilter.
Josh is a programmer, too: you may remember him as the creator of the weird and wonderful Garkov!
It was a great honor for Stack Overflow to make MetaFilter. I remain a longtime fan of MetaFilter and it definitely influenced the building of Stack Overflow. MetaFilter is a sort of collaborative blog with an amazing and incredibly effective (and eclectic) Q&A community.
MetaFilter has grown to five moderators over time. How do you decide who becomes a moderator? Does moderation scale? How much can/should the community police itself?
MetaTalk is the "backchannel" of MetaFilter, analogous to the "discussion" page on Wikipedia. It turns out there are two channels of communication in any social website. The topic, and then the topic about the topic. These are two very different audiences with very different needs.  
"technologically assisted profiling" is how MetaFilter works; the community flags questionable things (in addition to discussion on MetaTalk) and then the moderators act on those flags. MetaFilter is extremely strict -- they consider PR and blatantly promotional material spam, which rules out a huge section of what normally appears on Digg or Reddit.
MetaFilter has not voting, but it does have a favorites system, which is something we have planned for Stack Overflow. I follow the Best of MetaFilter feed which I believe is determined by how many people have favorited a given MetaFilter post.
In the rare event where a user goes haywire -- remember that it costs $5 to even join MetaFilter -- these users will be given "timeouts" of a day or two until they cool down. There are no scarlet letters or black marks that can be placed on users. The history of the user's actions, particularly if that history is public, is usually enough to handle the problem. We definitely agree with this philosophy.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twenty-first episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Road trip! The Stack Overflow team will be visiting the Fog Creek offices in New York City from Wednesday, September 24th to Sunday, September 28th. Hopefully Joel and crew will be completely moved in by the time we arrive.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>We&#39;re planning to launch the Stack Overflow website to the public on Monday, September 15th</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>As a <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/">fake plastic rock enthusiast</a>, there is another big item launching this week: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=rock%20band%202&amp;tag=codinghorror-20&amp;index=videogames&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Rock Band 2</a>! It&#39;s scheduled to appear Sunday September 14th. We purchased a complete set of fake plastic rock equipment, centered on Rock Band 2, to outfit the new Fog Creek offices and celebrate the newly public website.</p></li>
<li><p>An examination of Hegel&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">thesis, antithesis, synthesis</a> as applied to PC and Console gaming, and perhaps everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>I continue to believe game programming may be the most challenging and unforgiving kind of programming -- as <a href="http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html">famously documented by one spouse</a> in 2004. How do you optimize for &quot;fun&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel describes it as a &quot;big universe of dumb programmers&quot;, where Stack Overflow is (intended to be) an amplifier of the small bits of signal that come out of that supernova of mediocrity. We&#39;re part of it too!  </p></li>
<li><p>On the myth of expertise: fields of expertise in programming are very narrow, and it&#39;s remarkable how quickly you get off the beaten path, into techniques and approaches that almost nobody else is trying.   </p></li>
<li><p>How do you deal with users who set out to grief your system? Rather than outright banning or blocking, Joel proposes silently hiding that user&#39;s content from the world, in a way that is only visible to other users. As described in our previous podcast, the silent treatment is an incredibly powerful technique.  </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;You&#39;ve got a bunch of people playing Chess, but certain people want to play &#39;throw the chess pieces all over the park&#39; -- and from there it becomes a sort of wrestling and fighting game.&quot; I can&#39;t go to sleep -- <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">someone is wrong on the internet!</a></p></li>
<li><p>One of our &#39;playful&#39; users created giant posts by entering an amusing picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ducreux">Joseph Ducreux</a> a hundred times, so I changed the name of his account to that. Generally these kinds of posts automatically get deleted by the community when they reach the ten vote offensive threshold -- or they could be edited away by trusted users -- but I stepped in as a moderator.</p></li>
<li><p>The paradox of griefing is that these users are highly engaged with the system. Most people don&#39;t care and won&#39;t bother. So spending a lot of time gaming the system means you <em>must</em> like it on some level. If you&#39;re not careful you will turn these semi-engaged users into active and purposeful enemies. Joel proposes that users with a historical record of creating problem posts automatically get their content filtered to the bottom of the pile. He draws a comparison with bartenders not dramatically cutting off drunks, but serving them non-alcoholic drinks that look exactly like real drinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Incentives, like the badge system we use in Stack Overflow, despite being completely arbitrary, can have actual meaning in measuring and showing off your accomplishments. On the other hand, if you&#39;re not careful, you can end up with something like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000070.html">the despised Microsoft Ship-It awards</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>p.s. The Conversations Network, a not-for-profit organization which hosts our podcast, is looking for sponsors for their podcasts, including this one. It would be a very modest, NPR-style intro at the beginning... &quot;The StackOverflow Podcast is brought to you by Gummy Bears, Inc., bringing fine chewy treats to grubby children everywhere.&quot; If your company might be interested in sponsoring the podcast and becoming a hero to developers worldwide, or at least the eight developers who listen to the podcast, please <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/EmailtheAuthor.html">email Joel</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener question:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Clay Nichols</strong> of <a href="http://www.bungalowsoftware.com/">Bungalow Software</a> &quot;Did the badge idea come from Joel&#39;s experience in the Israeli military, or from Jennifer Aniston in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a>?&quot;</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twentieth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We figured out our deadlock problem, finally. It had to do with Log4Net being called during a database operation, itself triggering another database operation and log event. This is normally OK, but the events were happening so close together that it resulted in a deadlock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our new stackoverflow.com launch date is next week, as diagnosing the deadlock set us back at least four or five days.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s your logging philosophy? Should all code be littered with .logthis() and .logthat() calls? Or do you inject logging after the fact somehow?</p></li>
<li><p>Should you rely on third party libraries, or &quot;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html">find the dependencies and eliminate them</a>&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Having the source can make the difference between a dependency that works for you, and one that works against you. This is the great strength of taking dependencies on JavaScript libraries from the web -- <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000661.html">you can always View Source</a>. Perhaps this is why <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000857.html">JavaScript is the Lingua Franca of the web</a>, and increasingly the language young people will grow up programming.</p></li>
<li><p>One way we know Stack Overflow is already successful -- someone created a blog dedicated to hating Stack Overflow! If you can&#39;t get people to care one way or another about what you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ve definitely failed.</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to trolling, the most powerful countering technique at your disposal is to <em>not pay attention to it</em>. Which we have failed to do. My favorite literary interpretation of this is &quot;the silent treatment&quot; from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803725906/?tag=codinghorror-20">Great Brain book series</a> which I read and loved as a child.</p></li>
<li><p>We have implemented the transition point between traditional discussion board post ownership and wiki-style group ownership. The transition is forced when there are (n) edits by (n) users, or if there are (n) edits by the post owner. This rule also helps discourage people from bumping their posts by continually editing them, and reduces the perception of reputation gaming from people who try to build a large, collaborative post incorporating the comments of others.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking good questions is difficult. There&#39;s an art to constructing a question that appeals to your target audience, yet isn&#39;t an overt attempt to pander and farm attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s biggest problem, besides dealing with New York City landlords, is getting people to <em>not</em> do what he says just because he says so as their CEO and boss. Joel, as the big picture CEO, rarely has all the information necessary to make good, tiny, local decisions. That&#39;s your job!</p></li>
<li><p>There are tons of existing web Q&amp;A sites that we derive inspiration from, but we believe our more focused and directed programmer audience is what makes the difference. When the audience is very large and broad, you&#39;ll end up with things like <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/put-baby%27s-daddy-child-support/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=9116060">the baby daddy question</a> and the <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080823135822AAt923R">Georgia tanks question</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The current beta is definitely working, in that people posting questions are getting good answers and fairly quickly -- as you can see from <a href="http://girldeveloper.com/intar-social-commentary/stackoverflow-the-answer-to-quot-site-expertsexchange-quot/">Sara Chipps&#39; report</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel is in Boston at his <a href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software 2008</a> conference which is going on now. Joel is thinking up an introduction for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>, who by any measure is a legendary figure in the software community.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a filmmaker on site at the conference, filming footage to be incorporated into a sequel to <a href="http://www.projectaardvark.com/">Project Aardvark</a> in about a year or so. However, this will be a more technical look at how software is developed at Fog Creek and perhaps a primer on some tenets of good software development.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Trey Jackson</strong>: &quot;Why doesn&#39;t Jeff listen to Joel? How do you keep people interested in answering questions on Stack Overflow when the volume goes up?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Martin</strong>: &quot;What in your experience or background has been most useful while building Stack Overflow?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

We've mapped our voting functionality to what you see in Digg and Reddit, but we're a Q&A site, not a link aggregation service. Should we allow voting on questions as well as the answers? Or should questions simply be taggable as favorites, which are a de-facto vote? I believe voting and favorites are related, but not quite the same thing.  
How do you deal with meta-discussion about the site? Wikipedia has two distinct areas for any page: the page itself and the "behind the curtain" discussion about the page. We don't quite have this.  
Joel points out that Google's dedication to the algorithm over human intervention is on display in the Google search results for "jew".
The private beta is insular in a way that isn't immediately apparent to the people participating. We figure a huge percentage of our audience will be the barely interested programmers who end up on a Stack Overflow page from a web search. Also, the type of developers that tend to get attracted to the beta are the best, elite developers. Once the site is public, we'll have a far wider range of skills in play -- and much less sophisticated users.  
I realized that Joel has zero votes because we actually had a XSS vulnerability -- theoretically "friendly" hacker beta users intercepted our cookies and were able to impersonate us! We've fixed it now, but there was some minor collateral damage, such as the deletion of Joel's voting history. This is one of the challenges of developing a site for skilled (but bored) developers with time and ability on their hands. 
Joel cites Aaron Swartz' blog entry How To Launch Software as perhaps a model we should follow. The so-called "Hollywood Launch" tends to cause a huge, uncontrollable spike in traffic and then a massive drop as things don't go to plan. See Cuil. We are both scared stiff about the amount of traffic we already have, so we'll be proceeding carefully.
Our SQL Server deadlock problem was solved by switching to read committed snapshot. It turns out SQL Server is not tuned very well for typical web app loads, which consist of massive numbers of reads and miniscule numbers of writes.
The Stack Overflow database and webserver are currently the same machine. One easy scaling path for us is to buy another server and dedicating it to the database. I'm just unsure exactly where the transition point is for network latency versus the SQL calls staying in memory.
There is a huge difference between horrible legacy code by talented programmers and horrible legacy code by, well, horrible programmers. This is frequently measured in WTFs/minute.


We also answered the following listener questions:


Ryan Cox: "Can you talk about backup and disaster recovery plans?"
Ryan: "In developing database-centric software for multiple clients, why not use a single database rather than multiple databases for each client?"
Phil Howie: "How do you balance legacy code that nobody wants to update with programmers who want to use the latest and greatest stuff?"

<ul>
<li><p>Our team is geographically distributed -- I&#39;m in California, Jarrod is in North Carolina, and Geoff is in Oregon.   </p></li>
<li><p>Geoff and Jarrod, like me, both <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001104.html">grew up with BASIC programming</a> on early computers like the Apple // and Commodore 64. Can programmers who grew up programming somehow recognize each other?</p></li>
<li><p>The private beta is going well. We think the beta will continue through the month of August. We&#39;ll continue to add 150 users per day until the private beta is over.   </p></li>
<li><p>This entire podcast was inspired by community comments on the Stack Overflow blog, so we proceeded quickly to the following questions:  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following questions left from the blog:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;How do you manage collaboration on a distributed team? Is code ownership a problem?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;How do you prioritize what features you&#39;re working on?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;How do you test new features you&#39;re developing before you roll them out?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;What were the biggest technical challenges you had to overcome?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;What happened on the site that you didn&#39;t anticipate?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Are you happy with the performance of your Windows development stack on the web server?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Will you have an API? How will you deal with spammers, griefers, and marketers?&quot;</p></li>

<p>The Stack Overflow private beta list is essentially full until the end of the month. If you&#39;d like an invite sooner, do two minutes of transcription in the wiki and I&#39;ll bump you so you get an invite the same day.</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the sixteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/archive/2004/11/09/254664.aspx">Programmer design is scary </a>-- We now, thank goodness, have an actual designer design! Thanks to <a href="http://www.jeremykratz.com/">Jeremy Kratz</a> for assisting us with our design woes. We also appreciate input from <a href="http://www.timalmond.com/">Tim Almond</a>, Rob Allen, and Nathan Bowers.</p></li>
<li><p>We plan to have a smooth transition from cookie to authenticated user. I thought Jan Miksovsky had <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/05/hurdles_in_the_.html">a great post on login barriers</a>. I feel a lot of sites get this wrong by throwing up an abrupt login barrier too quickly. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000881.html">Tear down that login wall!</a></p></li>
<li><p>you have your choice of login methods: either <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2F&amp;ei=_4CQSPkzk5KxA53EreUF&amp;usg=AFQjCNEX-wMA2f6pCL-0ENtSDcgbxhB87g&amp;sig2=cwrJzl_WNy_c5qHi904nrA">OpenID</a> or the traditional three &quot;name, email, URL&quot; input boxes. You will be able to fully participate as a non-authenticated user -- both answer and ask questions. You may, however, be capped on reputation score and a few advanced abilities.</p></li>
<li><p>We will not be seeding the site with the data from the <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?dotnet">Joel on Software .NET forum</a>, as we feel it will bias the site too heavily towards that particular audience. Stack Overflow is intended to be non-denominational. We will be seeding the questions and answers on the site with the content generated by the private beta users.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the great advantages of the new Web 2.0 economy is that there are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/10/made-with-more-love-than-money.html">so few barriers between programmers and the world</a> -- assuming you&#39;re comfortable building a web site. Contrast this with the bad old days of distributing software on floppy disks or CDs.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you remember the first time you used Google? When and where did you discover it? How has Google <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000529.html">resisted succumbing the portalitis disease</a> after so many years? It&#39;s admirable that they&#39;ve pursued simplicity this long.</p></li>
<li><p>I am mightily impressed that the iPhone can render Stack Overflow, even the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://wmd-editor.com/">WMD editor</a> parts. Kudos to Apple for an (almost) no-compromises mobile web browser that delivers a desktop browser experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel loves his new <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/06/19/nokia-e71-review/">Nokia E71</a> phone, and he cites the physical keyboard as the primary differentiator -- along with the superior third party Exchange integration.</p></li>
<li><p>Revisiting my <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001146.html">programming chair article</a>. Although I loved my 1998 Aeron, I felt I could do better -- and the Mirra I&#39;m sitting in now is a distinct improvement. I&#39;m with Jason Calacanis: <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/03/07/how-to-save-money-running-a-startup-17-%20%20really-good-tips/">buy a cheap desk, and the best chair you can afford</a>. Joel recommends <a href="http://www.dwr.com/product/designers/a-c/don+chadwick/chadwick-chair-w--tilt.do?search=basic&amp;keyword=chadwick&amp;sortby=ourPicks&amp;page=1">the Chadwick Chair </a>which I didn&#39;t get a chance to try, unfortunately.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t forget <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000938.html">overall computer workstation ergonomics</a>; Joel also recommends <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/80837/Great-Adjustable-Height-Desk">variable height desks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On McConnell&#39;s <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000623.html">cone of uncertainty</a>, and the importance of keeping a list of what is to be done. You can&#39;t estimate without a list of tasks -- and you probably need to break the tasks down to very minute steps to really understand what those tasks entail, too.</p></li>
<li><p>As Joel points out, there is the risk of the &quot;Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear&quot; illusion -- your mind&#39;s eye tends to fill in the gaps. You gloss over the details and presume things will be simpler and easier than they actually are.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe in two principles during this project. First, having public artifacts that everyone can objectively see and judge. The team should develop a concensus opinion based on that reality. Second, have a plan -- but start on that plan as soon as possible! The sooner you get started, the sooner you will discover all the details and weirdnesses you could not anticipate or plan for.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel proposes having major plans for version two, and just getting a small version one out the door quickly. The actual usage of the app may not be at all what you imagined, and you can change your approach more rapidly to accommodate those real world uses for version two.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener question:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Josh Parris</strong>: &quot;Why did the Stack Overflow schedule blow out?&quot;</li>
</ol>

One of the great advantages of the new Web 2.0 economy is that there are so few barriers between programmers and the world -- assuming you're comfortable building a web site. Contrast this with the bad old days of distributing software on floppy disks or CDs.
Can you remember the first time you used Google? When and where did you discover it? How has Google resisted succumbing the portalitis disease after so many years? It's admirable that they've pursued simplicity this long.
I am mightily impressed that the iPhone can render Stack Overflow, even the jQuery and WMD editor parts. Kudos to Apple for an (almost) no-compromises mobile web browser that delivers a desktop browser experience.
Joel loves his new Nokia E71 phone, and he cites the physical keyboard as the primary differentiator -- along with the superior third party Exchange integration.
Revisiting my programming chair article. Although I loved my 1998 Aeron, I felt I could do better -- and the Mirra I'm sitting in now is a distinct improvement. I'm with Jason Calacanis: buy a cheap desk, and the best chair you can afford. Joel recommends the Chadwick Chair which I didn't get a chance to try, unfortunately.
Don't forget overall computer workstation ergonomics; Joel also recommends variable height desks.
On McConnell's cone of uncertainty, and the importance of keeping a list of what is to be done. You can't estimate without a list of tasks -- and you probably need to break the tasks down to very minute steps to really understand what those tasks entail, too.
As Joel points out, there is the risk of the "Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear" illusion -- your mind's eye tends to fill in the gaps. You gloss over the details and presume things will be simpler and easier than they actually are.
I believe in two principles during this project. First, having public artifacts that everyone can objectively see and judge. The team should develop a concensus opinion based on that reality. Second, have a plan -- but start on that plan as soon as possible! The sooner you get started, the sooner you will discover all the details and weirdnesses you could not anticipate or plan for.
Joel proposes having major plans for version two, and just getting a small version one out the door quickly. The actual usage of the app may not be at all what you imagined, and you can change your approach more rapidly to accommodate those real world uses for version two.  


We also answered the following listener question:


Josh Parris: "Why did the Stack Overflow schedule blow out?"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fifteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A brief discussion of our shoestring budget, and the project schedule. The beta for Stack Overflow is close; we will likely be trickling people in by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategies for handling recurring or background tasks in ASP.NET. We have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/easy-background-tasks-in-aspnet/">a simple method</a> that works for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a stellar software developer does not necessarily equate to being a stellar manager of software developers. Promoting your best coders is not always the best strategy. We highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633439/?tag=codinghorror-20">Peopleware</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159059844X/?tag=codinghorror-20">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a>. If you&#39;re a manager, staple these books to your face! Live it, learn it, love it! If you know someone who is a manager of software developers, staple these books to <em>their</em> face. They&#39;re that important.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s essential time management tip: get things done by not reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142000280/?tag=codinghorror-20">Getting Things Done</a>. Personally, my time management is terrible, but I do have one guiding principle: produce some kind of small public artifact every day. We can recommend <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann&#39;s excellent site 43Folders</a>, which is sort of a long running geek love letter to that book.</p></li>
<li><p>I argue that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001147.html">regions are the GOTO of code formatting</a>. I navigate in Visual Studio using search as my metaphor. Between CTRL+I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000432.html">incremental search</a> and CTRL+SHIFT+F find in project, I&#39;m never more than a few keystrokes away from whatever code I need to see. Your code is full of highly unique keywords, just like the web is full of unique search terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel and I both agree: one of the most effective coding practices you can adopt on your team is interactive, sit-down-with-your-coworker code review. 90% of the things you will learn have nothing to do with the code. I believe programming is a far more social activity than most realize. If you write code, and nobody but you <em>ever</em> sees that code -- did you really extract all the benefit from writing that code?</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to interviewing software developers, it seems there are two classes of interviews: the kind where the interviewee gets to drive, and the kind where the interviewer does all the driving. Try to have a game plan for both types of interviews. Be yourself, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000104.html">build a portfolio</a>, and actively study the company you&#39;re interviewing at. For some interviews, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000628.html">you really do need to prepare</a> -- practice, practice, practice!</p></li>
<li><p>We can&#39;t talk about programming interviews without mentioning <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/">classic interview puzzles</a> and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316778494/?tag=codinghorror-20">How Would You Move Mount Fuji</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>On the amazing power of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx">lambda expressions</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173171(VS.80).aspx">delegates</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0yw3tz5k(VS.80).aspx">anonymous methods</a>. Fun stuff!</p></li>
<li><p>If ACME is in the business of developing explosive widgets, is it unreasonable for them to inevitably outsource their software development to Coders R Us? If you&#39;re serious about software engineering as a career, you deserve to work at a company that is serious about software engineering, too. This usually means choosing to work for a company where software is at the core of their business model. See <a href="http://www.hjiang.net/wp/2008/01/05/joel-spolskys-talk-at-yale/">Joel&#39;s Talk at Yale</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We answered the following listener questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Gordon Milne</strong>: &quot;I have an opportunity to pursue a more managerial role; how do you feel about making the transition from developer to being responsible for other developers?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jason Zimpelmann:</strong> &quot;What sorts of time management skills do you use?&quot; and &quot;What about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001147.html">that posting on region blocks</a>?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aviv Ben-Yosef</strong>: &quot;Should code review be done alone via email or in person?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David McGraw</strong>: &quot;What advice would you give college graduates who are interviewing for programming jobs?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adam Haile</strong>: &quot;How do you handle pointers to functions in the .NET world?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matias A. Bellone</strong>: &quot;Outsourcing has been putting food on my table for the past few years. What are your feelings on this?&quot;</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This week&#39;s Rock Band downloadable content is epic -- <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/07/01/the-best-of-the-who-rock-band-tracklist-revealed/">the best of the Who</a>. Pointless podcast trivia: the Who song Baba O&#39;Reily is a concatenation of two influences, one philosophical, the other musical: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_O%27Riley">Meher Baba</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley">Terry Riley</a>. &quot;<em>They&#39;re all wasted!</em>&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>On Joel&#39;s post <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/07/01.html">Don&#39;t Hide or Disable Menu Items</a>. Joel considers this post an experiment in minimalism, to see if it is possible to write an extremely short piece that still works. I viewed it as a mistake; surely there&#39;s <em>something</em> between three tiny paragraphs and 5,000 words.</p></li>
<li><p>There should be a common UI metaphor for things that are disabled that provides a standard bit of interface to indicate <em>why</em> something is disabled. The specific situation that Joel ran into that motivated his post on this was the fact that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/06/listen-to-podcasts-in-less-time/">the accelerated playback mode of Windows Media Player</a> was disabled for Joel.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that comments are an important avenue for clarification and course correction in blogs, which is why they are so essential. Is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000538.html">a blog without comments even a blog</a> at all? It is what provides the conversational tone that makes them work.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel feels conversational nature is &quot;leading to the demise of blogs&quot;. People are relying on the conversation to complete the idea, rather than writing and researching the topic and presenting it as a coherent whole. It&#39;s more like hanging out with your friends and saying the first thing that pops into your head. Joel draws comparisons to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">eternal September</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>So much of programming is not easily measurable or quantifiable; it is explained by anecdote. I believe it is the reader&#39;s job to read critically and question viewpoints -- and demand some form of supporting data, beyond just one example or a few anecdotes. Don&#39;t let the most persuasive argument win; let the best data win.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel brings up a great point -- you should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word">avoid weasel words</a> in your writing! Or at least know when you&#39;re using them. And try to stop.  </p></li>
<li><p>On making decisions based on data: I believe you should automatically measure the number of queries and the time they take in your software. Based on that data, decide <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001152.html">how much to normalize your database</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel says the older he gets, the less he knows -- citing a few of his earlier posts. He plans to switch to story driven writing, free of agenda or morals. Let the reader interpret whatever message he or she wants into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps the ideal workspace is re-configurable by the group that works in it -- <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-innovations-microsoft%E2%80%99s-new-research-building">Microsoft&#39;s new research building</a> might be an example of this, or the the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=238321">Patterns &amp; Practices agile workspace.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A discussion on the perils of object relational mapping -- it&#39;s not called <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">the Vietnam of Computer Science</a> for nothing. We use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx">LINQ to SQL</a> on Stack Overflow and I have been quite happy with LINQ to SQL because it is 1) flexible 2) very lightweight and 3) built into the language as a fundamental construct, not bolted on in bunch of code generation or classes. </p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the thirteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel Spolsky still claims he is a New Zealander -- or at least his father was -- though I refuse to believe anything that is not in Joel&#39;s Wikipedia entry can possibly be true. More evidence: <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">FogBugz</a> uses the Kiwi as its logo.</p></li>
<li><p>I completely stole Yuval Tobias&#39; audio recording question about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001148.html">Spartan Programming</a> and posted it on my blog. My apologies, but it&#39;s a great topic, and I couldn&#39;t resist. You may also appreciate Steve Yegge&#39;s post <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html">Portrait of a Noob</a>, as it covers similar ground.  </p></li>
<li><p>Marco Arment was kind enough, in <a href="http://tumblelog.marco.org/41323518/my-lyrics-are-bottomless">My Lyrics Are Bottomless</a>, to expand on his earlier criticism. Marco, I can&#39;t bring myself to disagree with a fellow fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Conchords">the best two-man novelty band on the planet</a>. I&#39;d love to involve you in the private beta so we can benefit from your advice once you&#39;ve experienced the code in action.  </p></li>
<li><p>Joel says that ASP.NET is like driving a Lexus, and PHP is like riding a bicycle. Note: please direct all subsequent hate mails to Mr. Joel Spolsky, c/o Fog Creek Software, NY, NY.  </p></li>
<li><p>The original schedule for Stack Overflow had us going to the private beta this month (July). Based on the current progress, I believe we need 2 extra weeks to implement editing, and that&#39;s an essential part of the system. The key pieces need to be in place to get meaningful feedback in beta, so even if it slips a bit into August, the beta will be more useful. </p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow will implement an <a href="http://www.xbox360achievements.org/index.php">Xbox 360 like Achievement system</a> tied to your account. Our &quot;Badges&quot; system fulfills three roles: bronze badges encourage people to try all the different functions in the system, silver badges encourages continued participation, while completionists and hardcore users can strive to get the gold badges. All of this is completely optional, of course, but it is permanently visible on your Stack Overflow profile.  </p></li>
<li><p>We will also have a reputation system, which is a simple numeric score attached to your profile. It&#39;s based on the number of upmods your questions and answers get. It bothers us that on many voting based sites, a downmod completely cancels out an upmod. On Stack Overflow, an upmod will be worth twice as much as a downmod.</p></li>
<li><p>We hooked up <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a> on our project, so every checkin results in a build, unit testing, and deployment to the server. We also get email notifications of what changed and whether the build broke or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel&#39;s classic 2000 article <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">The Joel Test</a>. How does your team fare on these 12 points? If you&#39;re interviewing for a job, does that company pass The Joel Test? We also consider why unit tests aren&#39;t included in Joel&#39;s list, and whether they should be added.</p></li>

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the thirteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:


Joel Spolsky still claims he is a New Zealander -- or at least his father was -- though I refuse to believe anything that is not in Joel's Wikipedia entry can possibly be true. More evidence: FogBugz uses the Kiwi as its logo.
I completely stole Yuval Tobias' audio recording question about Spartan Programming and posted it on my blog. My apologies, but it's a great topic, and I couldn't resist. You may also appreciate Steve Yegge's post Portrait of a Noob, as it covers similar ground.  
Marco Arment was kind enough, in My Lyrics Are Bottomless, to expand on his earlier criticism. Marco, I can't bring myself to disagree with a fellow fan of the best two-man novelty band on the planet. I'd love to involve you in the private beta so we can benefit from your advice once you've experienced the code in action.  
Joel says that ASP.NET is like driving a Lexus, and PHP is like riding a bicycle. Note: please direct all subsequent hate mails to Mr. Joel Spolsky, c/o Fog Creek Software, NY, NY.  
The original schedule for Stack Overflow had us going to the private beta this month (July). Based on the current progress, I believe we need 2 extra weeks to implement editing, and that's an essential part of the system. The key pieces need to be in place to get meaningful feedback in beta, so even if it slips a bit into August, the beta will be more useful. 
Stack Overflow will implement an Xbox 360 like Achievement system tied to your account. Our "Badges" system fulfills three roles: bronze badges encourage people to try all the different functions in the system, silver badges encourages continued participation, while completionists and hardcore users can strive to get the gold badges. All of this is completely optional, of course, but it is permanently visible on your Stack Overflow profile.  
We will also have a reputation system, which is a simple numeric score attached to your profile. It's based on the number of upmods your questions and answers get. It bothers us that on many voting based sites, a downmod completely cancels out an upmod. On Stack Overflow, an upmod will be worth twice as much as a downmod.
We hooked up CruiseControl.NET on our project, so every checkin results in a build, unit testing, and deployment to the server. We also get email notifications of what changed and whether the build broke or not.
Joel's classic 2000 article The Joel Test. How does your team fare on these 12 points? If you're interviewing for a job, does that company pass The Joel Test? We also consider why unit tests aren't included in Joel's list, and whether they should be added.
What version number is your website? Should websites have a version number? Our website version number will be synchronized with the Subversion revision number, so we can be sure what version we're running.
A discussion of Charles Petzold's fantastic new book, The Annotated Turing. I cannot recommend this book highly enough; Petzold really makes the history and context of Turing and his seminal paper come alive. There's also a Broadway play Breaking The Code based on Turing's life.
Joel has a new book, More Joel on Software. Joel shares his thoughts on the merits and pitfalls of turning your blog into a book.
Joel decries the groupthink of Silicon Valley, and the flight from startup to startup. Joel thinks you can have a successful, original startup anywhere on the globe. You may want to maintain a US office, however.
The principle of progressive enhancement is why AJAX is more web friendly, whereas the "rounded rectangle in a browser" model of Silverlight and Flash isn't. Embrace and extend! There are a number of fairly mature JavaScript API libraries out there now, like jQuery, Dojo, and scriptaculous.  
Yahoo has some outstanding resources for web developers -- make sure you check out the Yahoo Developer Network.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the twelfth episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The difficulty of working on an airplane, even with an ultraportable laptop. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000927.html">I use the Dell XPS M1330</a>, which I love, but it&#39;s still marginal on an airplane.  </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not quite version control, but why doesn&#39;t our IDE automatically create lightweight versions every time we save?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel discovers the wide world of undervolting, which can dramatically reduce the power usage (and thus heat generation) of the Intel CPU inside the Macbook Air -- which is notorious for overheating. The program is <a href="http://www.coolbook.se/CoolBook.html">coolbook</a>; look into it if you have a Macbook Air.</p></li>
<li><p>Marco Arment provides this sage bit of advice: <a href="http://tumblelog.marco.org/40234086/dont-let-jeff-atwood-lead-your-web-project">Don&#39;t let Jeff Atwood lead your web project</a>. Too late! I try to avoid becoming the web equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Parry">Usenet&#39;s James Parry (kibo)</a>, the original egosurfer, by responding to every single post that includes my name. But it does give me an opportunity to reply via the podcast using an audio clip from my very favorite two man novelty band, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P2A6C0/?tag=codinghorror-20">Flight of the Conchords</a>.   </p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow is meant to replace some books, but by no means <em>all</em> of them. We love books! We spend the rest of the episode discussing Joel&#39;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html">Fog Creek Software Management Training Program reading list</a>. It is a fantastic list, filled with excellent reads that will broaden and inspire you as a software developer -- or software entrepreneur.</p></li>
<li><p>I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention my favorite technical book title of all time: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060008768/?tag=codinghorror-20">The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison: God Doesn&#39;t Think He&#39;s Larry Ellison</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not a book, exactly, but I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005N5QV/?tag=codinghorror-20">the 2001 documentary Startup.com</a> which provides a sometimes disturbing look into the hysteria at the height of the original dot-com era.</p></li>
<li><p>If you only read one book from this list, make it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633439/?tag=codinghorror-20">Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a>. And if you like that, walk the list of Demarco and Lister books and read a few more!</p></li>
<li><p>I have read <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/">Robert X. Cringely</a> for years. I love his older book <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000718.html">Accidental Empires</a> and the related three part video, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000718.html">Triumph of the Nerds</a>. I was disturbed to find out from Joel that there is <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/about/">more than one</a> Robert X. Cringely these days.</p></li>
<li><p>You own a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671027034/?tag=codinghorror-20">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</a> -- right? If not, why not? This is not a sleazy, ugly book like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060554738/?tag=codinghorror-20">The Game</a>. It&#39;s a timeless classic, as relevant today as it was over fifty years ago when it was originally written.  </p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the eleventh episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Addressing a few key bits of podcast feedback: we&#39;ll try to avoid talking over each other, and the 
callers who are asking questions, in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>On <a href="http://www.developer.com/design/article.php/3637441">the value of software postmortems</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>On data generation through <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts2008/products/bb933747.aspx">Team System Database Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm">Redgate SQL Data Generator</a>. If you don&#39;t have a tool to generate data, why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel provided me with a drop of the <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?dotnet">Joel on Software .NET discussion forums</a> for the purposes of data load testing. It&#39;s up and running, but we&#39;re not sure we will use it; it might bias stackoverflow.com too heavily towards .NET topics initially.</p></li>
<li><p>Why not use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/bestpractice/ftslesld.mspx">full-text searching in SQL Server 2005</a> for stackoverflow.com? Joel says it&#39;s too hard to use, the index server is too disconnected from the main database process; it just has too many gotchas overall.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel sings the praises of <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene.NET</a>; it provides excellent full-text search results for the hosted FogBugz.</p></li>
<li><p>Reginald Braithwaite&#39;s fine essay <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/09/we-have-lost-control-of-apparatus.html">We Have Lost Control of the Apparatus</a>, which correctly notes that most desktop apps in the corporate world now have to compete with web apps.</p></li>
<li><p>On rooting out assumptions in discussions, to make sure you&#39;re actually discussing the same topic: try using the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/22.html">five whys</a> technique Joel discussed.</p></li>
<li><p>The odd story of Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of <a href="http://www.belshe.com/software/">LookOut</a>, a popular and extremely fast indexing solution for Outlook. What happened? Why do so many large companies buy smaller software companies and then essentially kill them?</p></li>
<li><p>stackoverflow.com will be using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, but one downside of Markdown it the spec allows HTML. <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html">This opens us up to XSS exploits</a>, so we have to be very careful here.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do any sort of web programming whatsoever, <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html"><strong>please</strong> visit this page of XSS exploits</a>, so you can &quot;scroll&quot; for yourself how dangerous and pervasive the XSS problem is today.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of the complex rules for storing and rendering both Markdown and HTML in the same content. It&#39;s part of the spec, and it gives users a lot of flexibility. We store both the Markdown and rendered HTML representations in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>We are using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">prettify.js</a> which is almost magical in the way it works. It is used on Google Code, and it infers all syntax highlighting for most languages and content without any explicit markup indicating which language is in use. Are there other, better javascript syntax highlighters we should be looking at?</p></li>
<li><p>The difficulties of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/">Silverlight</a>: 1.0 versus 2.0, and the distinctly un-webbiness of the &quot;rectangle in a browser&quot; model. If Flash hasn&#39;t been able to overcome these obstacles in 10 years of use and near total ubiquity on the web, how is Silverlight going to?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m excited about the <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/">SquirrelFish project</a>, which promises to speed up plain old JavaScript running in the browser dramatically -- 1.5 times faster than Firefox 3, and 2.6 times faster than Opera.</p></li>
<li><p>On Steve Yegge&#39;s essay <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">Done And Get Things Smart</a> -- is the only reliable way to identify truly great people through actually working with them? Or following the social graph of &quot;name the greatest engineer you have worked with&quot; chain all the way back as far as you can?</p></li>
<li><p>Joel himself probably wouldn&#39;t pass <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/Interviews.html">the current interview process at Fog Creek</a>. Hiring is hard; it&#39;s better to err on the side of safety, which means a lot of great programmers will get turned down.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Stephen Hill</strong>:  &quot;What do you think of Microsoft&#39;s Silverlight?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dave Roberts</strong>: &quot;Joel, would you hire Jeff? If not, would you hire me?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#39;d like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode,  </p>

<p>record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to <a href="mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com">podcast@stackoverflow.com</a>.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the eleventh episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:


Addressing a few key bits of podcast feedback: we'll try to avoid talking over each other, and the 
callers who are asking questions, in the future.
On the value of software postmortems. 
On data generation through Team System Database Edition and Redgate SQL Data Generator. If you don't have a tool to generate data, why not?
Joel provided me with a drop of the Joel on Software .NET discussion forums for the purposes of data load testing. It's up and running, but we're not sure we will use it; it might bias stackoverflow.com too heavily towards .NET topics initially.
Why not use full-text searching in SQL Server 2005 for stackoverflow.com? Joel says it's too hard to use, the index server is too disconnected from the main database process; it just has too many gotchas overall.
Joel sings the praises of Lucene.NET; it provides excellent full-text search results for the hosted FogBugz.
Reginald Braithwaite's fine essay We Have Lost Control of the Apparatus, which correctly notes that most desktop apps in the corporate world now have to compete with web apps.
On rooting out assumptions in discussions, to make sure you're actually discussing the same topic: try using the five whys technique Joel discussed.
The odd story of Microsoft's acquisition of LookOut, a popular and extremely fast indexing solution for Outlook. What happened? Why do so many large companies buy smaller software companies and then essentially kill them?
stackoverflow.com will be using Markdown, but one downside of Markdown it the spec allows HTML. This opens us up to XSS exploits, so we have to be very careful here.
If you do any sort of web programming whatsoever, please visit this page of XSS exploits, so you can "scroll" for yourself how dangerous and pervasive the XSS problem is today.
A discussion of the complex rules for storing and rendering both Markdown and HTML in the same content. It's part of the spec, and it gives users a lot of flexibility. We store both the Markdown and rendered HTML representations in the database.
We are using prettify.js which is almost magical in the way it works. It is used on Google Code, and it infers all syntax highlighting for most languages and content without any explicit markup indicating which language is in use. Are there other, better javascript syntax highlighters we should be looking at?
The difficulties of Silverlight: 1.0 versus 2.0, and the distinctly un-webbiness of the "rectangle in a browser" model. If Flash hasn't been able to overcome these obstacles in 10 years of use and near total ubiquity on the web, how is Silverlight going to?
I'm excited about the SquirrelFish project, which promises to speed up plain old JavaScript running in the browser dramatically -- 1.5 times faster than Firefox 3, and 2.6 times faster than Opera.
On Steve Yegge's essay Done And Get Things Smart -- is the only reliable way to identify truly great people through actually working with them? Or following the social graph of "name the greatest engineer you have worked with" chain all the way back as far as you can?
Joel himself probably wouldn't pass the current interview process at Fog Creek. Hiring is hard; it's better to err on the side of safety, which means a lot of great programmers will get turned down.


We also answered the following listener questions:


Stephen Hill:  "What do you think of Microsoft's Silverlight?"
Dave Roberts: "Joel, would you hire Jeff? If not, would you hire me?"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the tenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We provide some background for new listeners on what Stack Overflow will be. See <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/04/16.html">Joel&#39;s post</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001101.html">Jeff&#39;s post</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Although we have ambivalent feelings about <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">Expert&#39;s Exchange</a>, what we&#39;re doing with Stack Overflow is similar, and they do have a sense of humor -- and invited me to a conference.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa&amp;wiki=true">cc-wiki licensing terms</a> for content posted on Stack Overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Hopefully we can ship before <a href="http://www.uberreview.com/2008/06/15-years-of-windows-apps-in-linux-wine-hits-version-10.htm">Wine</a> (which just hit version 1 after 15 years) and Duke Nukem Forever. Check out <a href="http://duke.a-13.net/">a list of things that have happened</a> since Duke Nukem Forever began development.</p></li>
<li><p>I confess that I was shocked to find out, while listening to our own podcasts, I wasn&#39;t hearing everything Joel was saying! Listening is hard. Make sure you&#39;re thinking about this the next time you listen to someone.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel has fun with <a href="http://www.instantrimshot.com/">instantrimshot.com</a> and I mention <a href="http://sadtrombone.com/">sadtrombone.com</a> ; these are excellent examples of the emerging classes of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/02/single-serving-sites">single-serving websites</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You crazy hackers figured out our super-secret beta website URL! I invite participation for the upcoming private beta, but our in-development site is not suitable for human consumption at this point. There is a special prize for those hardy few that &quot;hacked&quot; their way into the development site, though.  </p></li>
<li><p>A brief discussion of the badges that you can earn while participating in the Stack Overflow site. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinking_badges">We don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; badges</a>, of course, but I think they&#39;ll be fun and complimentary to the reputation system.   </p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow edits will only be possibly for users who have earned a little bit of reputation on the site by actively participating. This is where we diverge a smidge from Wikipedia, which still (amazingly!) allows regular anonymous edits. But I think it&#39;s a reasonable compromise: anonymous people can ask and answer, but not edit.</p></li>
<li><p>Jarrod did a tremendous job of getting our one-click build set up: it deploys the database, the code, and even runs unit tests against the website before deploying it. We&#39;re using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0k6kkbsd.aspx">MSBuild</a> and <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php">nUnit</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel references <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471197130/?tag=codinghorror-20">AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis (Paperback)</a>, and describes a few of the anti-patterns he&#39;s seen while developing small apps at Fog Creek for internal use.</p></li>
<li><p>On <a href="http://www.hjiang.net/wp/2008/01/05/joel-spolskys-talk-at-yale/">the dangers of being an internal IT developer</a>. This is important if you love coding.</p></li>
<li><p>One of personal favorite bits of Joel&#39;s writing, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000346.html">on cleaning the toilet</a>. Naturally.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes as a manager, it&#39;s your job to do the grubby, ugly stuff so the sales guys can sell and the developers can develop.</p></li>
<li><p>We use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> for Subversion integration as almost all other Windows developers do. But as Visual Studio developers, we&#39;ve also adopted <a href="http://www.visualsvn.com/">VisualSVN</a>, which I highly recommend! It makes working with Subversion a pleasure instead of a chore, at least in my opinion.   </p></li>
<li><p>At Fog Creek, they&#39;re switching to <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> source control, which like <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> is part of the new, emerging class of distributed version control.</p></li>
<li><p>Source control remains <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000643.html">the bedrock of software engineering</a>. I meet so few software developers, myself included, that really understand source control. Just <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html">avoid SourceSafe at all costs</a>, and understand <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000968.html">the value of branching and merging</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything positive anyone can possibly say about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windowsmobile/default.mspx">Windows Mobile</a>? How can something six versions old be this terrible? It should be razed to the ground and reinvented, ala Zune and Xbox 360. Can <a href="http://code.google.com/android/what-is-android.html">Google&#39;s Android</a> be like Windows Mobile, sans all the sucking? I expect Apple to dominate this closed ecosystem; it plays to all their strengths.  </p></li>
<li><p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language">Ruby</a> performance, scaling, &quot;enterpriseyness&quot; and whether or not this is even the right question to ask. Shouldn&#39;t we be thinking of this in terms of the solution first, and the language as a side-effect of that?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sebastian Dwornik</strong>: &quot;Doesn&#39;t the current mobile phone platform war remind you of the PC platform wars?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loren Norman</strong>: &quot;When will Ruby be ready for enterprise development?&quot;</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Apple&#39;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> is going on this week, and Joel has a few Fog Creek people at the conference.</p></li>
<li><p>at a WWDC party, I saw my friend <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/">Wil Shipley</a> of <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Monster</a>, who just so happens to be a FogBugz user. If you have a Mac, check out Delicious Monster 2!</p></li>
<li><p>On the use of Javascript -- <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/06/is-it-ok-to-require-javascript/">is it OK to require JavaScript</a> on today&#39;s web?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://dmiessler.com/blog/how-to-pronounce-os-x-proof-from-apple">How to pronounce OS X</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On Nicholas Carr&#39;s excellent Atlantic article <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google">Is Google Making Us Stupid?</a> His <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/">blog</a> is outstanding as well and highly recommended. Many people know him from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591394449/?tag=codinghorror-20">Does IT Matter?</a></p></li>
<li><p>On the challenges of tagging and hierarchy, and the folly of attempting to define popularity before it exists. </p></li>
<li><p>The StackOverflow private beta is still scheduled for early next month. We have to go through at least one full cycle privately with Joel first. Beyond that, we will be seeding the site with the existing content of the <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?dotnet">discuss.joelonsoftware.com .NET questions forum</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the absurdity and emotional emptiness of TechCrunch. Is it venture capital pornography?</p></li>
<li><p>A quick reference to my friend Matt Hempey&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6IQ_FOCE6I">Here Comes Another Bubble</a> video. It&#39;s so good, it won a webby award!</p></li>
<li><p>News flash: Joel adopts instant messaging technology, seven years after the fact!</p></li>
<li><p>We did our first server deployment of the stackoverflow code, where we ran into a little <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a> beta problem. We&#39;re crossing our fingers and hoping ASP.NET MVC will have a &quot;go live&quot; license before we enter the public beta.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel describes the way they use <a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/finalbuilder.aspx">FinalBuilder</a>, and I describe my brief dabblings with MSBuild.</p></li>
<li><p>On the strange sentiment of &quot;I agree with everything you&#39;ve written, except..&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Why does <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/002-8631162-3447259">Amazon&#39;s affiliate program</a> work, when Fog Creek&#39;s Fogbugz affiliate program did not?</p></li>
<li><p>How <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/12/matt-haughey-beat-google.html">Google Answers failed because they paid people</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/05/we-specialize-i.html">&quot;specialize in being a generalist&quot;</a>? Does that even mean anything? Expressing our general affection for Seth Godin, while acknowledging that he is, after all, a marketing weasel. But a really, really good one!</p></li>
<li><p>An example of specialization in action: how Larry O&#39;Brien&#39;s single post on programming Sabre <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,e5aadb98-0a69-44e3-94cb-0afa583b0c0e.aspx">generated the majority of his income.</a></p></li>
<li><p>How I personally wish the &quot;begins-with-www or doesn&#39;t-begin-with-www&quot; debate would just <em>go away</em>. Perhaps <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001109.html">some humor will help</a>? Probably not.</p></li>
<li><p>A final coda on Joel&#39;s question to our audience about password management.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener questions:</p>

<li><p><strong>John Topley</strong>: &quot;What are your thoughts on affiliate programs, such as <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1063-launch-announcing-the-new-37signals-affiliate-program-with-recurring-income">the new 37signals affiliate program</a>?&quot;</p></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the eighth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As of our next podcast, we will be hosted at <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/index.html">ITConversations</a> -- the <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> of podcasts. A good outfit to be associated with!</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, Joel does pronounce &quot;wav file&quot; as &quot;<em>wohv</em> file&quot;. I have no idea. Ask him.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel keynoted the Rails conference. Josh Susser said <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/5/31/quick-railsconf-update">&quot;If you missed it, count yourself lucky.&quot;</a> Apparently at least David Heinemeier Hansson liked it.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s true that I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001065.html">objected to David&#39;s attitude towards people who don&#39;t use Macs</a>, but it&#39;s possible to have objections to specific statements people make, or specific beliefs they may have, and still respect them as a person. Disagreement does not mean we are mortal enemies. David has a lot of smart, interesting things to say. That just wasn&#39;t one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The programming community is larger than any one particular tribe.&quot; But why are certain communities more insular and insecure than others? Joel relates this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I remain a big fan of Clay Shirky and his latest book. How big a fan? <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001122.html">It&#39;s Clay Shirky&#39;s Internet, We Just Live In It</a>. I believe every working programmer who touches the web should read his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594201536/codinghorror-20">Here Comes Everybody</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On addressing criticism -- &quot;there arise a new, young generation of rebels who remember not when you were the young rebel, writing new things, and making no claim to authority.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>I found <a href="http://barracadopaulo.blogspot.com/">Paulo&#39;s thoughtful criticism</a> of our podcast and I wanted to address it. To quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Randy Pausch</a>: &quot;Thatâs a lesson that stuck with me my whole life.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is the eighth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:


As of our next podcast, we will be hosted at ITConversations -- the NPR of podcasts. A good outfit to be associated with!
Yes, Joel does pronounce "wav file" as "wohv file". I have no idea. Ask him.
Joel keynoted the Rails conference. Josh Susser said "If you missed it, count yourself lucky." Apparently at least David Heinemeier Hansson liked it.
It's true that I objected to David's attitude towards people who don't use Macs, but it's possible to have objections to specific statements people make, or specific beliefs they may have, and still respect them as a person. Disagreement does not mean we are mortal enemies. David has a lot of smart, interesting things to say. That just wasn't one of them.
"The programming community is larger than any one particular tribe." But why are certain communities more insular and insecure than others? Joel relates this to cognitive dissonance.
I remain a big fan of Clay Shirky and his latest book. How big a fan? It's Clay Shirky's Internet, We Just Live In It. I believe every working programmer who touches the web should read his latest book, Here Comes Everybody.
On addressing criticism -- "there arise a new, young generation of rebels who remember not when you were the young rebel, writing new things, and making no claim to authority."
I found Paulo's thoughtful criticism of our podcast and I wanted to address it. To quote Randy Pausch: "Thatâs a lesson that stuck with me my whole life. When you see yourself doing something badly and nobodyâs bothering to tell you anymore, thatâs a very bad place to be. Your critics are your ones telling you they still love you and care." 
Joel feels like he was misunderstood on the topic of exceptions. Well, if you were writing a memory allocator for an operating system, anyway.
Joel and I do agree that threading is hard. It's amazing that web apps largely get a pass on this, thanks to the architecture of the webserver model.
I give a shout-out to Rick Brewster of Paint.NET who calls the (excellent) threading code he wrote in Paint.NET "easily the most complex code in Paint.NET"
We're using SQL Server 2005 as the underlying database for stackoverflow.com. We engage in a brief discussion of the pros and cons of Oracle and MySQL databases in our (limited) experience.
Joel describes his frustration with the way some writers turn single anecdotes into statements of truth, both on the internet and off. Of course Joel and I are both guilty of this, too.
In my better blog posts, I tend to use more of a meta-aggregation model, where I do research and summarize what I found. I point to a lot of different opinions, then offer my own -- but I try to diligently avoid clinging religiously to my opinions. In the face of new, better data, I can be convinced. I firmly believe in strong opinions, weakly held.
When it comes to Domain Specific Languages, we definitely prefer them to a bunch of XML. I am particularly fond of SQL and Regular Expressions as mini-DSLs -- I believe in embracing the concept of languages inside languages.
Joel and I are still very excited about Microsoft's DLR (IronPython and IronRuby) as an escape route from the superficial differences between the Coke and Pepsi of C# and VB.NET.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the seventh episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many thanks to Stuart Cam for recording a stackoverflow theme song; a brief digression on the introductions to the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NUT07eZoXPw">Sopranos</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=cscedJQ3PFU">Get Smart</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>How programmers know it&#39;s a holiday: the door to the office is locked, or the Google <a href="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html">logo changes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuesday is also Rock Band new song download day. This week was pretty epic -- the <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=cars+rock+band">complete album The Cars</a>. Joel would like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(song)">the 1975 song Convoy</a>. Maybe he&#39;s a CB radio fan?</p></li>
<li><p>Working from home, I miss some of the camaraderie of my fellow programmers. What can I do about that? I&#39;ve always admired Joel&#39;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">commitment to creating a good working environment</a> for programmers. Joel has <a href="http://www.inc.com/query/index.html?domains=http%3A%2F%2Finc.com%2Chttp%3A%2F%2Ftechnology.inc.com%2Chttp%3A%2F%2Fhiring.inc.com%2Chttp%3A%2F%2Fblog.inc.com&amp;client=pub-9871731465474413&amp;safe=active&amp;channel=&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23FFFFFF%3BVLC%3A8B9EB1%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BALC%3A336699%3BLC%3A336699%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3AAAAAAA%3BGIMP%3AAAAAAA%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%3BFORID%3A11%3B&amp;q=joel+spolsky&amp;xsubmit.x=0&amp;xsubmit.y=0&amp;xsubmit=Search&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Finc.com">a regular column in Inc. magazine</a>, and the June issue happens to cover this topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel calls <a href="http://www.officesnapshots.com/">http://www.officesnapshots.com/</a> &quot;office pornography&quot;, where &quot;pornography&quot; is described as &quot;looking at pictures of things you can&#39;t have.&quot; It&#39;s also sort of like <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/cribs/series.jhtml">MTV Cribs</a> for the IT set.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel points out that cool office common areas are great, but what <em>really</em> matters is the desk where you actually do your work.</p></li>
<li><p>I like to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000905.html">build my own PCs</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000959.html">use three monitors</a>, so it&#39;s difficult for me to bring my work with me without it <a href="http://improveverywhere.com/2008/02/25/mobile-desktop/">turning into a comedy routine</a>. Another reason I enjoy having my own office: I&#39;m into decorating -- <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000770.html">see my old office at Vertigo</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do private offices interfere with collaboration and pair programming?</p></li>
<li><p>Which configuration of monitors is ideal for programming?</p></li>
<li><p>I profess my love for <a href="http://reptils.free.fr/index.htm">WinSplit Revolution</a>, which I consider essential on any monitor larger than 22&quot;. We also wonder why OS window managers aren&#39;t smarter about edge snapping and using available desktop space intelligently.</p></li>
<li><p>An extended discussion of <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. I encourage everyone reading this to sign up for an OpenID and try it yourself. I recommend <a href="http://www.myopenid.com/">myopenid</a>. Joel signs up for an OpenID live on the podcast.</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of proper <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/2007/11/26/openid-ax/">OpenID attribute exchange</a> -- so you can store your avatar image, URL, birthday, address and so forth in one place and have it handed over automatically to websites from your OpenID provider. Without this, OpenID is much less attractive.</p></li>
<li><p>A discussion of Eric Sink&#39;s <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">C and Morse Code</a> -- isn&#39;t programmer time spent learning C better spent learning how to communicate and understand the business domain they&#39;re working in? There&#39;s a deeper topic of Systems Analyst vs. Programmer here that we&#39;ll have to dig into.</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder: Joel will be in Portland keynoting <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a> later this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Joel wants people to write in about their preferred password management solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>As usual, thank you for all the questions and for the Wiki edits! We appreciate all the interest in the private beta signups, too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also answered the following listener question, with a lot of peripheral discussion on related topics:</p>

<li><strong>John Dyer</strong>: Isn&#39;t it better for programmers to program using standard programming frameworks and libraries rather than creating things from scratch?</li>

Trivia clarifications from podcast #3: Leonardo DiCaprio on Growing Pains, and how the Fonz actually Jumped the Shark in Happy Days
Thanks for all the offers to pitch in and help!
The StackOverflow private beta should be in about 6-8 weeks.
My depressing lack of project planning: Joel maintains I need a task list. In Fogbugz, of course.
A discussion of the ASP.NET login provider model and NTLM, and how to enable NTLM in Firefox.
A correlation between the prevalence of NTLM and Microsoft's model of developing software for corporations versus developing software for consumers.
A discussion on David Heinemeier-Hansson's excellent Startup School talk: Is it pathetic that someone needs to stand up at a startup school and tell people that they need to charge for their product?
Businesses will spend money -- consumers won't. You can't make money selling commodities to consumers as a startup; you have to sell a luxury.
The Google model: get the eyeballs, figure out how to make money later. Is that fair to startups? Can every startup make it to the necessary scale to get that revenue model to work?
experiments with AdSense on fakeplasticrock.com and codinghorror.com (search)
Why Joel and I feel compelled to run ad-blocking software in our browsers. Why doesn't it block the Google search result ads? Are search result ads more task-related and thus useful?
Jamie Zawinski on social networking websites: they should get you laid.
I try to get Joel to use Twitter again, and he references the Penny Arcade cartoon. I still think it's useful. Follow me on Twitter!
A (very) long -- but worthwhile -- discussion about my recent post on XML.
Revealing Notepad's "bug".
Apps like RescueTime which track what applications you're running over time.
Discussion of an email from Michael Dorfman, wherein he is embarrassed on my behalf for my lack of computer science rigor.
Joel questions the sense of humor of his readers.
A brief bit of advice from Joel on washing your electronics, and how to fix your computers by dropping them. Hey, I didn't say it was good advice.
Thank you for all the questions and for the Wiki edits!

A brief, but awesome, reference to Donald Gibb in Revenge of the Nerds.
We are now using Skype and Pamela to record our podcast for higher quality.
Joel's original 2002 Recommended Programmer Reading list and Jeff's Top 5 Programming Books -- and why stackoverflow.com will complement, not replace, these kinds of books.
The ineffable Steve Yegge, and a digression on the philosophy of Apple and Microsoft font rendering strategies.
Confirming that stackoverflow.com will be as language agnostic as we can make it. It is for programming questions, whatever the language and platform. Yes, it's true that Joel and I have a Microsoft background, but we respect that programming is far larger than Microsoft.
Why You Should Learn C (again).
On our technology stack: stackoverflow.com will be built in ASP.NET running on our dedicated Windows Server 2008 x64 box -- but that doesn't mean stackoverflow.com, the site, will be about ASP.NET!
On jumping the shark.
An extended examination of everyone's favorite language: Wasabi! Along with some reasons why you might actually want to build your own DSL and compiler.
A discussion of our logo contest at 99designs.com.
What, exactly, is a stack overflow?


We also answered the following listener questions, with a lot of peripheral discussion on related topics:


Dave Kauffman: On Computer Science versus Software Engineering: is there any real-world use for recursion?

Nathan Stohlmann: How do we plan to keep religious discussions from happening on stackoverflow? will we provide a way to show implementations in multiple languages?
Matt Youell: How will we handle spam or reblogged content from stackoverflow? What about licensing issues with user-generated content?
Andrew Davis: How will we prevent stackoverflow quality from diminishing over time as the site becomes more popular?
Andre Bluehs: Should I learn C++?


If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, 
record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to podcast@stackoverflow.com.

The transcript wiki for this episode is available for editing.
