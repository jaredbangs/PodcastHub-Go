		<description><![CDATA[Audio diaries from officers who work behind bars at North Carolina's Polk Youth Institution.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polk Youth Institution in Butner, North Carolina is a prison for young men between the ages of 19-25.  For our series Prison Diaries, I gave tape recorders to a handful of inmates at Polk to tell the story of life behind bars.  After visiting the prison for a few months, I realized I had been overlooking the stories of the guards. Pretty much every guard I talked to said they serve time too – in eight hour shifts. In this episode of the Radio Diaries Podcast, listen to the audio diaries of prison guards.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this golden age of podcasting, a conversation about the past and future of public radio with the author of the original NPR mission statement.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best mission statements we&#8217;ve ever read is the original NPR mission, which was written in 1969 by Bill Siemering. Bill is an amazing guy who, at the age of 80, continues to help create radio stations and programs in developing countries around the world. The manifesto Bill wrote is no longer NPR&#8217;s official mission statement but it&#8217;s a lovely reminder of why we do this work. It&#8217;s truly worth reading. </p>
<p>Here at Radio Diaries we like history &#8211; including our own. So with help from the good folks at Transom.org,  we brought Bill into a studio because we were curious how he came to write that original mission statement, and why. We asked him to look back at the history of public media, and to imagine the future. We also asked him to read part of that original NPR mission statement.</p>
<p>You can also read a transcript of our conversation at Transom.org, thanks to Jay Allison, Sydney Lewis and Samantha Broun. If you don’t know about Transom…go there as soon as you can. It’s like a master class in radio storytelling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s podcast is about what it takes to get people to change. We focus on a group of people that might be the hardest to change &#8211; or at least they’ve had the most money thrown at them in hopes of change: Criminals.</p>
<p>Back in 2006, Richmond, CA was named the ninth most dangerous city in the country, with 42 murders for a population of about 100,000. Then they brought in a new police chief and started doing all kinds of things differently. And it worked. Homicides are now a third of what they were. Crime has dropped in a way that is dramatic and impressive. And police say that one of the things that helped is a program called the Office of Neighborhood Safety, or ONS. That’s a bland name for what is actually a very unusual program with one particular tactic that you do not hear about people trying very often: paying criminals to not commit crimes. Sounds crazy, but the even crazier part is&#8230;it works. </p>
<p>This story originally aired on This American Life, in the episode, The Incredible Rarity of Changing Your Mind. Thanks to Ira Glass and the entire staff of This American Life for their help on this story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck, for the rain to gather, for the wind to suck, for the sun to rot, for a tree to drop. Here is a strange and bitter crop.” -Abel Meeropol</p>
<p>Poet and songwriter Abel Meeropol wrote that lament after seeing a photograph of two black teenagers hanging from a tree, after being lynched in Marion, Indiana, on August 7, 1930. Meeropol&#8217;s song, &#8220;Strange Fruit&#8221; was later made famous by Billie Holiday. A secret, missing from the photograph, is that a third black boy was supposed to die that fateful day. James Cameron is believed to be the only African American to have survived a lynching.</p>
<p>Listen to our story (and be advised that it is disturbing.)</p>

		<itunes:summary>James Cameron is the only person known to have survived a lynching. This is his story. And this is also the story of the white residents of Marion, Indiana who witnessed or took part in the fateful events of August 7, 1930. In the 1970’s, some of their memories were recorded on cassette tapes, put in a box, and then forgotten for decades. Those cassettes were found in a basement a few years back, and you’ll hear them throughout this story.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bridgette McGee grew up knowing nothing about her grandfather, Willie McGee. Now she is on a quest to unearth everything she can about his life – and his death.</p>
<p>In 1945, Willie McGee was accused of raping a white woman. The all-white jury took less than three minutes to find him guilty and McGee was sentenced to death. Over the next six years, the case went through three trials and sparked international protests and appeals from Albert Einstein, William Faulkner, Paul Robeson, and Josephine Baker. McGee was defended by a young Bella Abzug arguing her first major case. But in 1951, McGee was put to death in Mississippi’s traveling electric chair. His execution was broadcast live by a local radio station. Today, a newly discovered recording of that broadcast provides a chilling window into a lost episode of civil rights history. Narrated by Bridgette McGee, this documentary follows a granddaughter’s search for the truth about a case that has been called a real-life To Kill A Mockingbird.</p>

		<itunes:summary>You probably don't know her name, but you definitely know her songs. Rose Marie McCoy passed away recently at the age of 92. On this episode of the Radio Diaries Podcast, we’re remembering Rose and her music.

In the 1950's and early 1960's American pop music saw the melding of different genres - rhythm &amp; blues, country, and rock &amp; roll - bringing together black and white, northern and southern musical styles.
 
Rose was one of the most prolific songwriters of that era. She wrote more than 800 songs recorded by singers like Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Dizzy Gillespie, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Big Maybelle, Ruth Brown, James Brown, Sarah Vaughan, Johnny Mathis and Aretha Franklin.</itunes:summary>

Fourteen people were killed. Debris from the plane severed the cables of an elevator, which fell 79 stories with a young woman inside. She survived. The crash prompted new legislation that – for the first time – gave citizens the right to sue the federal government. Listen to this story on the Radio Diaries Podcast.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beauty pageants promote the fantasy of the ideal woman. But for 35 years, one contest in New York City celebrated the everyday working girl.</p>
<p>Each month starting in 1941, a young woman was elected “Miss Subways,” and her face gazed down on transit riders as they rode through the city. Her photo was accompanied by a short bio describing her hopes, dreams and aspirations. The public got to choose the winners – so Miss Subway represented the perfect New York miss. She was also a barometer of changing times.</p>
<p>Miss Subways was one of the first integrated beauty pageants in America. An African-American Miss Subways was selected in 1948 – more than thirty years before there was a black Miss America. By the 1950s there were Miss Subways who were black, Asian, Jewish, and Hispanic – the faces of New York’s female commuters. </p>
<p>In this episode of the Radio Diaries Podcast, meet the Miss Subways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moment Nelson Mandela really became Nelson Mandela was on April 20th, 1964 &#8211; fifty years ago today. It happened when he stood up in a stuffy South African courtroom and gave a speech.</p>
<p>50 years is a long time. It&#8217;s long enough for things to become history.  Long enough that people start to be forgotten, stories get smoothed over, narratives get hardened in stone. That&#8217;s what happened this past December with the death of Nelson Mandela. His life story was written&#8230; in sharpie.</p>

		<itunes:summary>November 23, 1936 was a good day for recorded music. Two men – an ocean apart – sat before a microphone and began to play. One was a cello prodigy who had performed for the Queen of Spain; the other played guitar and was a regular in the juke joints of the Mississippi Delta.

But on this day 75 years ago, Pablo Casals and Robert Johnson both made recordings that would change music history.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>16 years ago, Juan reported on his life as a recent Mexican immigrant living in poverty in Texas. In his new diary, Juan takes us on a tour of the life he has built since he first crossed the Rio Grande. It looks a lot like the typical American dream: a house, 2 cars, 3 kids—except for the fact he’s still living illegally in the U.S. In this podcast, listen to Juan's diaries as well as a conversation about the recording process with producer Joe Richman.</itunes:summary>
