<p>We don&#8217;t have metrics to measure what happens when we read something that changes our life. So this episode is an attempt to deal with that.  We begin with writer <b>Rob Walker </b>who tells us about his &#8220;New Old Thing,&#8221;  a regular feature he produces for Yahoo Tech. Rob is one of the most thoughtful writers I know and if anyone can wean us from our addiction to the now it will be him. I also get to talk to one of my heros this week: <b>Edwin Frank </b>who is the editor in chief of the NYRB classics imprint. About 10 years ago I read a collection of Platonov stories, a book that definitely changed my life, and I became a life-long devotee of the series. I have always wanted to ask Edwin about his editorial sensibilities and what exactly binds all the books with the well designed multi-coloured spines together. <b>Phyllis Rose </b>is the author of The Shelf.  She &#8220;randomly&#8221; chose a shelf at the library near her house and read every book on it &#8211; then she wrote about the experience. It is a deep funny philosophical treatise on the act of reading itself.</p>

<p>After moving to New York alone, writer Olivia Laing discovered the truth about loneliness. <em>She says it is a gift</em>.  Eric Klinenberg explains why more and more people are choosing to live alone and why cities like New York must invest in housing stock that singletons <em>actually want to live in</em>, the type of housing they have in Scandinavian countries.  In Denmark when someone dies alone, and no-one claims the body, the authorities put an ad in the newspaper calling for<em>Possible Relatives</em>. This is also the title of a photo-book by Danish photographer Tina Enghoff.  She tells us about the pictures she took of the apartments after the dead were removed. Some of these bodies went undiscovered for months.</p>

<p>Cédric Villani won the prestigious Fields Medal for his work in 2010.  He wrote a book about his experience called Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure. It is a book about where ideas come from. There is something spider like about Villani, and I say that not just because of the pins he is famous for always wearing. He knows how to catch ideas, and he wants to teach us how as well. We also talk with Maria Popova about another great Science book: The art of Scientific Investigation. I found this book thanks to the idea catching web that Maria Popova built:   <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/25/the-art-of-scientific-investigation-1/">brainpickings.org</a>.</p>

<p>Yours truly is recuperating from 2014 in France but wishing you a happy holiday. Hope you enjoyed the programming this year. The dislike club series pretty much contains everything I have ever wanted to say about social media. Been thinking about all this stuff for quite some time now,  but it all started to crystalize when I got invited to Russia three years ago. I made a show about that trip for my old radio program &#8220;too much information&#8221; (it used to run on WFMU). I updated it a bit and offer it here, as the ToE 2014 holiday special &#8211; <em>or the dislike club prequel.</em></p>
<p>***ALERT*** heard from a bunch of you now that you can&#8217;t find the DISLIKE CLUB Finale. Just search for this word: RADIOTONIC and you will find a radio show called <em>Radiotonic</em> from the ABC&#8217;s Creative Audio Unit. They commissioned the finale. Download it <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/radiotonic/">here</a>. Or subscribe to their <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/feed/5421368/podcast.xml">podcast</a>. Look for the Dec 21st episode called the Dislike Club &#8211; that is part VI (the finale).</p>

<p>Paul Ford is a technologist and a writer, sometimes these two things blur. For example, he’s currently working on a book about webpages, but he’s also building a content management system for webpages &#8211;  because you know it could help with the writing.  (yeah his book is late) Its not like he&#8217;s trying to procrastinate, this is just what life is like when you are Paul Ford.  A couple of Monday night&#8217;s ago he was sitting on his couch drinking some rye whisky and chatting with his friends on twitter  and he accidentally a brand new webpage community.  This is the true origin story of his tilde.club. Yours truly also started a new thing it is called dislike.club.

<p>When I was in Beijing last summer I dropped by the Microsoft research campus to talk with  Dr. Yu Zheng. He studies the air pollution in his city, and the noise pollution in mine. Using algorithms he is able to predict what kinds of noises New Yorkers are most likely to hear in their neighborhoods, take a look at his <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/citynoise/">Citynoise</a> map. His algorithms could one day help city planners curb air pollution and noise or as Christian Sandvig notes they could be used by the GPS apps on our mobile devices to keep us from walking through neighborhoods perceived to have loud people hanging around outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/">Christian Sandvig</a> studies algorithms which is hard to do, most companies like Facebook and Google don’t make their algorithms public. In a recent study he asked Facebook users to explain how they imagine the Edgerank algorithm works (this is the algorithm that powers Facebook’s news feed). Sandvig discovered that most of his subjects had no idea there even was an algorithm at work. When they learned the truth, it was like a moment out of the Matrix. But none of the participants remained angry for long. Six months later they mostly reported satisfaction with the algorithms that determine what the can and can’t see. Sandvig finds this problematic, because our needs and desires often don’t match with the needs and desires of the companies who build the algorithms.</p>
<p>“Ada’s Algorithm” is the title of <a href="http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/adas-algorithm/">James Essinger’s new book</a>. It tells the remarkable story about Ada Lovelace the woman who wrote the first computer program (or as James puts it &#8211; Algorithm)  in 1843. He believes Ada’s insights came from her “poetical” scientific brain. <a href="http://findingada.com/about/meet-alds-founder/">Suw Charman-Anderson</a>, the founder of Ada Lovelace day, tells us more about this remarkable woman.</p>

<p>When the photographer <strong>Garry Winogrand</strong> died in 1984 he left behind hundreds of thousands of unpublished negatives and undeveloped rolls of film and a few out of print books that are still treasured by connoisseurs and photo book collectors today. It&#8217;s always bothered <strong>Leo Rubinfien</strong> that his friend Garry’s legacy is bound up with these hard to find books, for leo a much better way to appreciate the genius of Garry Winogrand is through his slideshows. Recently Leo Rubinfien got an opportunity to show the world the Garry Winogrand he knew and loved, <strong>SFMOMA</strong> invited him to guest curate a Winogrand show. The exhibit  took years to put together, and at the outset SFMOMA&#8217;s assistant curator of photography <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/920"><strong>Erin O&#8217;toole</strong></a> was nervous, but she tells us why she is now in the cult of Winogrand too.  While your host was in Australia this summer he met up with one of his new favorite artists, the cartoonist <a href="http://girlmountain.tumblr.com/post/85821182607/excerpt-from-the-jobs-section-of-life-zone"><strong>Simon Hanselmann</strong></a>. Simon is one of the most compelling voices of his generation, but while his characters are all sex, drugs, and rock and roll Simon just works. Also we reminisce about the early days of the web with ToE regular <strong>Peter Choyce</strong> who believes he had one of the first ten blogs. Three reminders that being an artist will always be hard.</p>

We don&#8217;t have metrics to measure what happens when we read something that changes our life. So this episode is an attempt to deal with that.  We begin with writer <b>Rob Walker </b>who tells us about his &#8220;New Old Thing,&#8221;  a regular feature he produces for Yahoo Tech. Rob is one of the most thoughtful writers I know and if anyone can wean us from our addiction to the now it will be him. I also get to talk to one of my heros this week: <b>Edwin Frank </b>who is the editor in chief of the NYRB classics imprint. About 10 years ago I read a collection of Platonov stories, a book that definitely changed my life, and I became a life-long devotee of the series. I have always wanted to ask Edwin about his editorial sensibilities and what exactly binds all the books with the well designed multi-coloured spines together. <b>Phyllis Rose </b>is the author of The Shelf.  She &#8220;randomly&#8221; chose a shelf at the library near her house and read every book on it &#8211; then she wrote about the experience. It is a deep funny philosophical treatise on the act of reading itself. I will be gifting this book to my friends for years.</p>

<p>This week we examine the legacy of <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibility</em> by Walter Benjamin.  Media Theorist and Benjamin scholar (and translator) Thomas Levin explains why this essay resonates today and what Benjamin has to tell us about the utopian power of new media. Also Russell Meyer tells us about the Wu-Tang clan&#8217;s plan to release a sole copy of their new album and why he has turned to Kickstarter so he can buy it and release it to the world. And your host shares an imaginary story about Hitler and Goebbels encountering Benjamin&#8217;s essay during their final days in the bunker.</p>

<p>After moving to New York alone, writer Olivia Laing discovered the truth about loneliness. <em>She says it is a gift</em>.  Eric Klinenberg explains why more and more people are choosing to live alone and why cities like New York must invest in housing stock that singletons <em>actually want to live in</em>, the type of housing they have in Scandinavian countries.  In Denmark when someone dies alone, and no-one claims the body, the authorities put an ad in the newspaper calling for <em>Possible Relatives</em>. This is also the title of a photo-book by Danish photographer Tina Enghoff.  She tells us about the pictures she took of the apartments after the dead were removed. Some of these bodies went undiscovered for months.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Writer Olivia Laing didn’t plan on moving to New York alone, but after a few lonely months in the city she discovered the truth about loneliness. She says it is a gift. Laing wrote an essay on loneliness for Aeon magazine. She is also the author of The Trip to Echo Spring, which is one of the best books of the year — no contest.

Eric Klinenberg says more and more people are choosing to live alone and that cities like New York must invest in housing stock that single people not only can afford but actually want to live in, the type of housing they have in Scandinavian countries. He is a sociologist at New York University and the author of Going Solo, a book about the extraordinary rise and surprising appeal of living alone.

In Denmark when someone dies alone, and no-one claims the body, the authorities put an ad in the newspaper calling for Possible Relatives. This is also the title of a photo-book by Danish photographer Tina Enghoff. She took pictures of some of these apartments after the bodies were removed, often the bodies go undiscovered for weeks. My friend Pejk Malinovski, who is also a Dane (and a radio producer) met up with Tina on a recent trip home to Copenhagen.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>About a year ago I travelled across America. I visited Airports, Amusement parks, Highways and Community Colleges in order to understand how the priority queue is changing the American experience of waiting in line.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Even though waiting in line is an essential part of the human experience,  there is no such thing as a Universal Queue. The most famous Queue is the traditional serpentine queue.  First in, first out. It’s fair and democratic.
The priority queue is something totally different.
 In the priority queue some people get to wait less than others.  Most often, because they pay more.
Americans do have a deep rooted belief in the market, and since priority queues can generate revenue it’s no surprise that they are turning up in the public sector as well.
But are traditional American values like fairness and equal opportunity really compatible with letting someone buy their way to the front of the line? And what happens when the people who pay more want more? America is already suffering from extreme polarization, is it really a good idea to mess around with systems that further divide citizens into haves and have nots?</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>Gabriella Coleman tells us about her time among the Hackers, "Chris" makes his TOE debut with the truth about the alleged Chinese hacking of the NYT, and your host ponders hiring a hacker to break into George RR Martin's computer.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>These days, it seems that everyone is getting hacked. Fast Food companies, News Organizations, everyone living in the United States... 
The highlight of this week's installment is a conversation about hackers with Anthropologist Gabriella Coleman. She's in the news all the time now when hackers make headlines and she's done some of my favorite work on Anonymous and Internet culture.
Gabriella Coleman began her academic career in the Bay Area, researching the Free Software movement. This research is the basis of her book Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking. 
Gabriella showed up on the scene,  just around the time the Free Software movement was rebranding itself as "Open Source." It turns out that there are too many meanings of the word free in the English language: free beer... free speech... But when the government started using the DMCA to crack down on coding, Hackers bonded together around a very specific definition of the word. 
This installment marks the first appearance of someone I have been recording for years: my friend "Chris" He is always up to something amazing, but I am always suspicious that he may be pulling my ear-leg. This time he gives us the "truth" about the alleged hack of the New York Times by the Chinese. 
Also,  your host wonders if it might be possible to hire a hacker to break into George RR Martin's computer so that he can read the rest of the Game of Thrones story without having to wait 10 years like everyone else.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>The torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty were extremely controversial. Supposedly, they even cost the film an Oscar, Argo, the CIA’s other propaganda effort for 2012, trounced ZDT at the Academy Awards. 
There is no factual evidence that connects any intelligence gleaned from torture with the successful operation that took out Osama Bin Laden but this movie uses the magic of Hollywood to cement the two together forever. Recently I decided to watch these torture scenes with Joshua Phillips, a journalist who spent years researching the effects of torture on detainees and interrogators. He is the author of None of Us Were Like this Before: American Soldiers and Torture.  At Joshua's apartment we recorded a torture commentary track for our imaginary Criterion edition of the film. 
We will probably never learn the truth about how we found Osama Bin Laden. But there is one thing I know for certain. We didn’t get the information from Umarov Muhibullah.
Journalist McKenzie Funk ran into Umarov, one of the first men to be released from Guantanamo, while hiking in Tajikistan. Umarov told Mackenzie that the US held him for two years before letting him go. He was never told why we had been detained nor was he compensated in any fashion.  This was a scoop, but Mackenzie was young and he couldn’t get any major media interested in the story. It did run in  Mother Jones. In 2010 Wikileaks released a number of Guantanamo related files, including documents that attested to the innocence of Umarov and others.  
Mackenzie and I put this story together two years ago. The week US forces killed Osama Bin Laden. For a brief second I thought this might be when we come to our senses and close Guantanamo once and for all. But it is still open. Today 100 inamates are on hunger strike. I believe they have finally learned the truth about Guantanamo: it will never close.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>Our series concludes with some revelations. Metahaven uses the story of Wikileaks to show us the infrastructure of the cloud and its super-jurisdictional powers. The BBC’s Paul Mason takes us on a wild tour of China in his novel Rare Earth.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>The landing from the digital onto the material is hard; it comes with a cruelty and intensity we haven’t even begun to properly understand. - Metahaven

I got the chance to meet Metahaven (Daniel Van Der Velden and Vinca Kruk) when they were in NYC this winter for a show at MoMA PS. They have been studying the connections between the digital and the material for years in their museum shows, design work and collaborative projects.
I spoke with them about their essay “Captives of the Clouds” serialized in the journal e-flux.. They use the story of Wikileaks to expose the infrastructure of the cloud. I now believe November 30th, 2010 just might be the actual birthday of the cloud, a day almost in the middle of our Bieber timeline (from episode one) 
The BBC's Paul Mason has done some serious reporting on Rare Earth but he told me that on the last night of a trip he made in late 2009 he realized he would have a much easier time getting the story right in a novel. I read a lot about Rare Earth for this radio series and this novel was by far the most enlightening (and the most fun). 
On my last night in China I met up with an old friend who used to run a Chinese blog business. In 2007 he came through New York and told me he was determined to do something tangible, something more real. Now he uses the cloud to power his very successful online mail order business that connects customers with Chinese factories. He takes me to a bar (very much like one described in Paul Mason's novel) where I finally get some... clarity? All thanks to a pile of iPhones.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Over the years, technology has become more and more invisible. But all of that invisible technology is really based on increasing use of more and more exotic materials like rare earths -  and its the rare earths that make it all work. - Dr. Alex King
Dr. Alex King leads the Critical Materials Institite in Ames Iowa, he says that if I could get inside a Cloud Data Center I would find the Neodymium, a Rare Earth Element, in most of the custom hard drives. And companies like Amazon he says, now use wind turbines packed with giant Neodymium magnets to power and cool these hard drives.
There are 17 Rare Earth Elements. They are crucial for the production of electric cars, medical devices, drones, and clouds.
When I learned that 95% of the World's Supply of Rare Earth comes from China I decided to go there. I wanted to see a Rare Earth Mine with my own eyes.</itunes:summary>

Twitter employee #7 tells us what happened when Justin Bieber joined twitter in 2009. An Amazon Data scientist, explains how the cloud is changing our relationship with technology, Obama’s CTO Harper Reed explains why the cloud is awesome + we tour Parse, a hot hot hot (BaaS).

		<itunes:subtitle>Twitter employee #7 tells us what happened when Justin Bieber joined twitter in 2009. An Amazon Data scientist, explains how the cloud is changing our relationship with technology, Obama’s CTO explains why the cloud is awesome + we tour Parse,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In many ways the cloud is just another Internet Buzz Word: Interactive, Web 2.0, Social Media, the cloud. But we now spend most of our time living and working in the cloud, and most of us have no idea how it works, what it does, what's different, or what it all means. This was really bringing me down. So I decided to make a radio show. 
We start off with Britt Selvitelle (Twitter employee #7).  He tells us what happened when Justin Bieber joined Twitter in 2009 and how everything had changed by the time the Bieb joined Instagram in 2011. What makes these two stories different is that the popular photo sharing application instagram built its platform using Amazon Web Services, the cloud.  Matt Wood, Amazon’s principal data scientist, explains how individuals and businesses are using the cloud and how it is changing our relationship with technology.
Amazon officially launched its product in 2006, but at some date in between these two events,  the cloud comes into its own. The exact date doesn't actually matter - what's important  is that most of us, including technologists like Britt Selvitelle, didn't even notice.
 Harper Reed, was the CTO for Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, and he is one of the smartest technologists I know. 
He tells me how the campaign used Amazon Web Services and why Cloud infrastructure is awesome.
I recently saw a Cloud Ad on the subway.  It wasn't an Ad for Amazon but one of their competitors, it was kind of like the one above. It was a picture of a man climbing up a mountain with his bare hands, this man didn't have a shirt on, and you could tell he worked out at an expensive gym, perhaps with a personal trainer. There was an ipad or a tablet tucked into the back of his shorts, apparently he was so good at climbing - he didn't have to worry about it falling out. In the sky written in big white fluffy letters was a sentence that read: Experience the mobility and freedom of working in the cloud. There is a lot of Hype about the cloud, the recruitment Ads for cloud companies are just as nutty as the cloud product Ads. 
I went to San Francisco to talk to someone who works in the Cloud. I found Charity Majors  
Charity works at Parse. Parse is a Back-end-as-a-Service company. 
But as hard as I tried, I could not get into the cloud itself.</itunes:summary>
