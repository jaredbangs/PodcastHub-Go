On today's show Guillermo, Heath and I talk about everything from be "careful not to offend" and sexism in the workplace to <a href="http://crowdscriber.com" target="_blank">my startup</a> and the Scala-based technology stack I chose.</p>
<p>Heath brought up a good point, when we speak at conferences these days we have to be *really* careful not to offend anyone. The advent of social media provides a soap box for anyone who feels even slightly offended by what you say. We've seen this play out over the past few years in <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/CouchDB_talk" target="_blank">extreme cases</a> but it has slowly evolved itself into a "you can't offend *anyone*, however the slightest".</p>
<p>Attendees of these conferences aren't exempt, as evidenced by the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/03/21/sexism-public-shaming-via-twitter-leads-to-two-people-getting-fired-including-the-shamer/" target="_blank">public outting</a> of a couple of developers who were making sexually suggestive jokes. To the subsequent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681" target="_blank">firing of one of those developers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1376454638607_big-290x300.png" alt="Github" width="290" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2090" /><br />
Finally, sexism in the workplace is nothing new, it has plagued our female friends ever since they hung up the apron to bring home the bacon. However, we're hearing more of it in the Tech sector as more women are involved in tech jobs. I remember being in university, out of a class of 200 Comp/Sci students I could count the number of women on one hand. That's changing, and it's a hard adjustment for some guys. Granted, what a lot of people overlook in the case of  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/" target="_blank">Github vs. Julie Ann Horvath</a> is the fact it appears to be at its core a problem between two women (Julie and a co-founder's wife). That being said, GitHub sounds like high school all over again. One of the complaints Julie had was that some male coworkers were "gauking inappropriately" at some female coworkers while they hula hooped in the office. Hula hooping in the office? WHAT THE FUCK. That's your problem right there.</p>
<p>*Sigh* maybe some day things will get easier between the two sexes... </p>
<p>Until then, enjoy!<br />

In today's episode <a href="https://twitter.com/javageek" target="_blank">JavaGeek</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/craiger" target="_blank">I</a> talk about his facination with the MMORPG EVE Online. Charactarized as "Spreadsheets in Space", EVE requires a lot of attention and learning. Being a programmer, JavaGeek of course had to develop a set of tools to give him the upper hand.</p>
<p>If you are at all interested in trying EVE yourself, please use JavaGeek's referral link. That way, he'll get a bonus (which he'll share with you, <a href="http://twitter.com/JavaGeek" target="_blank">just hit him up on twitter</a>). The credits he can give you through the referral help tremendously as a new player.</p>

Ever want to learn another language? I'm not talking Ruby, I mean an actual spoken language? Well, I'm currently learning Japanese, and I've drawn some <a href="http://tataryn.net/a-programmers-guide-to-japanese/" target="_blank">interesting parallels to it and Programming</a>.<br />

I also discuss a really awesome tool called "<a href="http://www.humanjapanese.com/" target="_blank">Human Japanese</a>" I picked up for iOS and MacOSX. The teaching style used in this courseware is exactly how I learn things myself. I fail terribly when I try to learn a language conversational, I need to know rules and why things are the way they are so I can then reason my way through a conversation.</p>

And finally, Conferences. I bitch a bit about JavaOne <a href="http://tataryn.net/javaone-2014-why-i-wont-be-submitting/" target="_blank">from a speaker's perspective</a>, wax prophetic about this curious "<a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/attendees/diversity-scholarships" target="_blank">Diversity Scholarship</a>" that Strange Loop has going on and express my desire to checkout <a href="http://qconsf.com" target="_blank">QCon SF</a>.</p>

Wow, it's been a while!  Well we're back with a brand new cast.  Our castmate Guillermo Castro (aka <a href="http://javageek.org/">JavaGeek</a>) is heading off to <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a> 2013.  There is at least one easter egg on that site, if you click on the I and the 0 in the sequence: IOOOIOOO you'll get to a new page that lets you play with a cool synthesizer (as depicted in the image to your right).  Neat!</p>
<p>We'll also talk a bit about "<a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a>", specifically about some of the concerns relating to the data that could be collected when using the glasses.</p>

<p>Hi!  It's been a while.  Well to make up for it, we have a great interview with Jeff Atwood!  Jeff's contribution to the internet has left quite the footprint.  Not only is he the prolific blogger behind the site <a href="http://codinghorror.com">Coding Horror</a> but also co-founder and creator of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> and the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange</a> suite of Q&#038;A sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com"><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/stackoverflow.png" alt="" title="stackoverflow" width="128" height="128" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1861" /></a><br />
I mean really, what developer *anywhere* around the world hasn't heard of or hasn't used StackExchange?  It's an amazingly well thought out site, the reason it works so well is not by accident, it was painstakingly planned right down to the very last pixel.  For insight on how StackOver flow came to be, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php?feed=podcast">StackOverflow/Exchange podcasts</a>. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entrycontent">
As mentioned in our previous cast with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ekabanov" target="_blank">Jevgeni Kabanov</a>, a fellow by the name of <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-1/" target="_blank">Erkki Lindpere</a> from <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com" target="_blank">ZeroTurnaround</a> wrote a three-part series of blog posts titled "<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-1/" target="_blank">Scala Sink or Swim</a>". Basically a set of things you should know before considering Scala for a project. An excellent read, and I highly recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>From the moment I read the title I thought "oh boy, let the flame wars begin!" and they did for a while in the comments section of the blog.  However, the ZeroTurnaround guys aren't a lot to be pushed around.  You can talk Monads and all sorts of category theory.  They'll respond in kind.  You can tell them "you aren't smart enough to undersand what you are talking about" and they'll point you to their doctoral thesis on the subject at hand.  They are a smart bunch, and Erkki is certainly no exception.  Especially since Erkki is a self proclaimed lover of the Scala language!  He's just pragmatic and down-to-earth as well.  He points out the "Elephant in the room", instead of trying to step around it.</p>
<p>The posts resonated very well with me, a lot of the pain points associated with Scala are laid out in *plain english*.  I found myself nodding my head much more than shaking it back and forth (until I got to the comments section, then there was a lot of head shaking).  Everything is in there from the S in <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki" target="_blank">SBT</a> perhaps being mislabeled to the complexities that library developers can introduce into your program *just because they can*.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend you have <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-1/" target="_blank">a read</a>, and then a listen!</p>

<p>Enjoy!

<p>Jevgeni fills us in about the new product releases of JRebel and LiveRebel happening over at <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com" target="_blank">ZeroTurnaround</a> and we also discuss the hot-button topic that is OSGi.  You see, Jevgeni is a bit outspoken against OSGi, where as our own cast member Jeff Genender is an OSGi fan boi.  Me?  Well I'm just continually asking myself "OSG-why?"  If I can't get a canonical dependency like Hibernate to work with it, what is it's point of existence...</p>
<p>Also Jevgeni mentions <a href="http://geekout.ee/" target="_blank">GeekOut</a> which is the Estonian Java Developer's June 14-15 2012 which boasts a great line up of speakers.  Since it's taking place in Estonia, birthplace of ZeroTurnaround, you know it's gonna be a non-stop geek party as well!</p>
<p>Thanks for the great cast Jevgeni!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/scumbag-steve"><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/scumbag-growl.png" alt="Scumbag Growl" title="Scumbag Growl" width="175" height="196" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1683" /></a><br />
For those who may not know, the developer of <a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a>, that great little notifier app for OSX decided they <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12">should be paid for their work</a>.  There is one slight problem however.  Growl is Open Source Software.</p>
<p>It's not like we've never seen this before.  A company starts an open source product, gets a bunch of people to contribute to it and then keeps a separate branch of development for themselves and their paying customers.  Eventually enhancements and bug fixes make their way into the Open Source version of the product.  In the case of Growl however OSX Lion happened, and what better way to profit than to create a private branch of Growl, put all the fixes needed to operate Growl under OSX Lion and throw it up on the AppStore for $1.99.  Yeah, they never bothered to feed the fixes back into the OSS version of Growl. They took their proverbial ball and they're going straight to the bank with it.<br />
<a href="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/testing-mother-fuckers-do-you-do-it.jpg"><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/testing-mother-fuckers-do-you-do-it-300x208.jpg" alt="Testing Mother Fuckers Do You Do It" title="Testing Mother Fuckers Do You Do It" width="300" height="208" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1685" /></a><br />
One of the biggest problems with this approach, other than the fact they just pissed off a lot of people who beleive strongly in OSS, is that Growl is still broken.  So you pay your $1.99 and it no workie.</p>
<p>So while these snake-oil salesmen are busy fleecing their users via the AppStore along comes a guy who's had just about enough.  A paying customer who was extremely dishearten by the fact a piece of software he paid for just didn't work as advertised.  His name is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/perrymetzger" target="_blank">Perry Metzger</a>, and he <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pmetzger/growl/" target="_blank">forked Growl</a>.  Not only did he fork it, he fixed it, and it's free.  Now the road for Perry wasn't smooth, he tried to reason with the authors of Growl, he tried to help existing users who were left out in the cold, and the thanks he got was a cease and desist and a one month ban from the Growl mailing list.  Open Source Software indeed.</p>
<p>Have a listen to Perry's story and please <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/perrymetzger" target="_blank">let him know</a> he's fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Prashant Deva is not some hipster "<a href="http://www.quora.com/Brogramming/How-does-a-programmer-become-a-brogrammer">brogrammer</a>".  No, he's about as hard-core geek, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack">John Carmack</a>-level coder.  He's the fellow that brought us <a href="http://www.placidsystems.com/antlrstudio.aspx">ANTLR Studio</a>, to give you some bearing on his skills.  While preparing for this podcast I 1) realized he never sleeps 2) he's very enthusiastic about <a href="http://www.chrononsystems.com/">Chronon</a>.</p>
<p>In this interview Prashant takes us through Chronon which he describes as a 'DVR for debuggers'.  That's right, you can actually step through a program that has already run!  An invaluable tool for tracking down those nasty production bugs.  The product is amazing, it's not a simple gimmick and I believe it will become the de-facto standard for JVM-based production servers.</p>

While preparing for this podcast I 1) realized he never sleeps 2) he&#039;s very enthusiastic about Chronon.
In this interview Prashant takes us through Chronon which he describes as a &#039;DVR for debuggers&#039;.  That&#039;s right, you can actually step through a program that has already run!  An invaluable tool for tracking down those nasty production bugs.  The product is amazing, it&#039;s not a simple gimmick and I believe it will become the de-facto standard for JVM-based production servers.
Watch the video:

Enjoy!

In this Episode Craig has former cast member Alex Demko on to speak about Linux turning 20 years old and the sad news that Steve Jobs is too sick to continue in his role as visionary CEO at Apple and resigns.

This is our first podcast to introduce video!  There were some bumps and I learned a lot (all explained in the first 3 minutes of the video) but all-in-all it didn't turn out that bad.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, and chances are you haven't, it's an MVC Javascript framework that has some real legs.  It promotes the concept of rich client-side programming with a "dumb" back-end.  So picture a scenario where you have an <a href="http://basementcoders.com/2010/11/episode-23-interview-with-shay-banon-of-elastic-search/" target="_blank">Elastic Search</a> server running on your back-end and Angular running in the browser.  All the pulling and pushing of JSON, the event handling, etc.. would be handled by Angular.  It looks pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The framework <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">is hosted on github</a>, and its development is sponsored in part by Google.</p>

Especially since OSX Lion is such a major update, it's not like Snow Leopard which only brought bug fixes.  Instead, Lion brings all new features and paradigms, such as being able to install your OS without even visiting a physical store to purchase it.

<h2>Google+</h2>
<p>Well <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/">Google+</a> is upon us, and at the time of our taping we were just getting our invites.  We've had a chance to test drive it a bit since then and it does look like a serious contender for Facebook and possibly Twitter!</p>
<p>The amount of control you get over "who sees what" is pretty awesome, and they accomplish this through the concept of "circles".  So you have a "circle of friends" or "circle of acquaintances" or maybe even a "circle of jerks"?  <img src='http://basementcoders.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The neat thing about Google+ is I can treat part of my social graph like Twitter.  That is, people I add to my circles don't necessarily add me to theirs.  This is akin to me following <a href="http://twitter.com/BillGates">@BillGates</a> on Twitter but he doesn't necessarily follow me.  I think the trick for Google+ will be to figure out how to get people to be "open" with their status updates and sharing given all the granularity they provide for controlling such things.  The other trick of course is, besides the geeks, how are they going to get Joe Public to wander over from Facebook given there is no way to export your social graph to Google+?<br />
<a href="http://mac.github.com"><img alt="" src="http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/200808/github-profile.png" title="Git Hub" class="alignleft" width="300" height="450" /></a><br />
The one thing that bugs me a bit (<a href="http://twitter.com/craiger">Craig</a>) is the fact that Google also <a href="http://google.com/chrome">makes a browser</a> and a <a href="http://www.android.com">mobile platform</a>.  Will Google+ be "best viewed on Chrome and Android"?  So far it is. </p>
<h2>Git Hub</h2>
<p>As many of you know, kids today don't only have to worry about bullying on the playground.  Bullying is now a global activity.  Through online gaming and social networks Cyberbullying has become an epidemic, in fact one of my immediate family members is bullied right now online to the point where the Police are involved.  And its not just the meek who are bullied, even kick-ass-guitar-playing-martial-arts-knowing coders like <a href="http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1306816425.html"><b>Zed Shaw</b> are victims</a>.  Sometimes we don't call that bullying but rather trolling or stalking, but it amounts to the same thing.  What was happening to Zed was facilitated by the fact that on Git Hub a user could add *anyone* they wanted to their project, the person being added had no choice in the matter.  This was akin to the famous <a href="http://consumerist.com/2010/10/facebook-welcomes-you-to-nambla.html">Facebook-NAMBLA</a> loophole.</p>
<p>Zed is known for being <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com.sharedcopy.com/rants/51489cec9386f7c13f69b3a58cd50b02.html">audacious and a bit outspoken</a>.  So for many it was probably tough to feel sorry for him, and it appeared those sentiments were shared by those running Git Hub.  So it wasn't until Zed <a href="http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1306816425.html">crashed GitHub</a> and made it public that GitHub decided to <a href="http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1306948009.html">do something about it</a>.</p>
<p>Other links discussed in this cast:</p>

This was akin to the famous Facebook-NAMBLA loophole.
Zed is known for being audacious and a bit outspoken.  So for many it was probably tough to feel sorry for him, and it appeared those sentiments were shared by those running Git Hub.  So it wasn&#039;t until Zed crashed GitHub and made it public that GitHub decided to do something about it.

Everyone has probably done it, you've broken the build.  Now you might <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/79041/how-to-apologize-when-you-have-broken-the-nightly-build">feel the need to apologize</a>.  Should you?  Or is it an excusable act, assuming you only do it once in a blue moon?</p>
<p>We'll share some of our own techniques on how to minimize your build breaking ways.  In fact, if you follow the steps below, the chances of you buying doughnuts for the team will be greatly minimized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do an update from your VCS, fix any conflicts which might have resulted</li>
<li>Do a full compile of the code base</li>
<li>Run unit tests, ensure no failures</li>
<li>Check again for changes in VCS, repeat from step 1</li>
<li>Now check-in your changes with a USEFUL commit message (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unhappycoder/status/8909490370">unlike these ones</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, I really liked this video from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=778890205865&#038;oid=9445547199">Facebook Engineering on how they deploy builds</a>.  Especially liked the concept of "Commit Karma".  Anytime you break functionality or the build, you lose karma.  A build engineer integrating your code uses your karma as a sign post for how closely he has to monitor your commits.</p>
<p>Other topics:</p>

</div>

<p>Gabriel Weinberg is someone I've wanted to interview ever since I first heard of the <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine.  I've always been intrigued by search technology and was pretty impressed by the fact that just one guy could create and maintain a search engine on his own.  Couple his achievement with the fact that Gabriel is a very genuine and approachable fellow, anytime I emailed him; whether it be for a DuckDuckgo suggestion or related to the podcast; he always responded in a prompt and courteous manner.  Surprising considering he's not a <strong>serial</strong> entrepreneur he's more of a <strong>parallel</strong> one.  Being really busy with DuckDuckGo as well as <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/angel.html">investing in new start-ups</a> I appreciate him making time for the little guys in independent internet media.</p>
<p>So why does DuckDuckGo matter?  DuckDuckGo filters out a lot of what you might call "search spam" like link baiting landing pages and tends to prefer search results which have been filtered by human eyes.  That's why you'll see Wikipedia and other human powered search sites get better ranking in DuckDuckGo.  </p>
<p>Another great feature is Privacy. If you want to <a href="http://donttrack.us/">search without being tracked and marketed</a> to then you'll like DuckDuckGo.  Or what if you only want to search YouTube for a certain video?  Using the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">"bang" syntax</a> in your searches act to filter your search terms by category.  As a Java programmer are you really annoyed whenever a JDK 1.4 API doc gets top ranking when you're trying to get the JavaDoc for HashMap?  Bang syntax to the rescue:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>!java5 HashMap</code></p></blockquote>
<p>If you are interested to learn more about DuckDuckgo, <a href="http://twitter.com/Jason">Jason Calacanis</a> had <a href="http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/this-week-in-startups-72-with-gabriel-weinberg/">interviewed Gabriel</a> back in August, it's worth the listen as well.  A lot of people don't like Calacanis, they find him too abrasive, aggressive and egomaniacal, that doesn't make his advice not worth listening too.  He has a real knack for getting your entrepreneurial motor in gear.  Whenever I feel down about my pet project, I just listen to Jason and the people he interviews and it makes me realize that I can "do it" too, it just takes some faith in yourself and a lot of sweat and tears to get there.  So if you had to compare our interview with Gabriel to Jason's it would come down to the fact we actually ask Gabriel technical questions around how things are glued together at DuckDuckGo.  </p>
<p>The easiest way to try DuckDuckGo is to make it your browser's default search provider.  You can do that by going to the <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo homepage</a> and clicking on the link under the search box labeled "Add to &lt;your browser name here&gt;".  Try it out for a week, you'll most likely keep it.</p>
<p>Have a listen to find out!</p>

Gabriel Weinberg is someone I&#039;ve wanted to interview ever since I first heard of the DuckDuckGo search engine.  I&#039;ve always been intrigued by search technology and was pretty impressed by the fact that just one guy could create and maintain a search engine on his own.  Couple his achievement with the fact that Gabriel is a very genuine and approachable fellow, anytime I emailed him; whether it be for a DuckDuckgo suggestion or related to the podcast; he always responded in a prompt and courteous manner.  Surprising considering he&#039;s not a serial entrepreneur he&#039;s more of a parallel one.  Being really busy with DuckDuckGo as well as investing in new start-ups I appreciate him making time for the little guys in independent internet media.
So why does DuckDuckGo matter?  DuckDuckGo filters out a lot of what you might call &quot;search spam&quot; like link baiting landing pages and tends to prefer search results which have been filtered by human eyes.  That&#039;s why you&#039;ll see Wikipedia and other human powered search sites get better ranking in DuckDuckGo.  
Another great feature is Privacy. If you want to search without being tracked and marketed to then you&#039;ll like DuckDuckGo.  Or what if you only want to search YouTube for a certain video?  Using the &quot;bang&quot; syntax in your searches act to filter your search terms by category.  As a Java programmer are you really annoyed whenever a JDK 1.4 API doc gets top ranking when you&#039;re trying to get the JavaDoc for HashMap?  Bang syntax to the rescue:
!java5 HashMap
If you are interested to learn more about DuckDuckgo, Jason Calacanis had interviewed Gabriel back in August, it&#039;s worth the listen as well.  A lot of people don&#039;t like Calacanis, they find him too abrasive, aggressive and egomaniacal, that doesn&#039;t make his advice not worth listening too.  He has a real knack for getting your entrepreneurial motor in gear.  Whenever I feel down about my pet project, I just listen to Jason and the people he interviews and it makes me realize that I can &quot;do it&quot; too, it just takes some faith in yourself and a lot of sweat and tears to get there.  So if you had to compare our interview with Gabriel to Jason&#039;s it would come down to the fact we actually ask Gabriel technical questions around how things are glued together at DuckDuckGo.  
The easiest way to try DuckDuckGo is to make it your browser&#039;s default search provider.  You can do that by going to the DuckDuckGo homepage and clicking on the link under the search box labeled &quot;Add to &lt;your browser name here&gt;&quot;.  Try it out for a week, you&#039;ll most likely keep it.
Have a listen to find out!

<p>Let's face it, in this business there are two types of people:  Those that deliver and those who don't.  What you may  not know is that the differentiating factor could be as simple as whether or not a person has a trusted system in place which allows them an easier time at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>.<img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/dilbert_productivity.jpg" alt="" title="" width="232" height="141" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1320" style="margin-top:10px"/><br />
<br/><br />
When someone is productive they tend to be goal oriented;  they know what they want to achieve and more importantly <strong>how they can go about doing so</strong>.  A lot of people think that these achiever-types are just "naturally gifted", however the only "natural" inclination common amongst them is that completing tasks drives them to achieving goals.  Fear not! <strong>This can be learned!</strong>  Try it yourself.  Write a simple task list out for Saturday chores (Shovel the walk, get the groceries, fill the tires in the car, etc...).  You'll find that you start feeling good by not only completing those chores, but also from the sense of accomplishment which comes in crossing them off the list.  That sense of accomplishment you get drives you to do more and the side effect of all this is larger goals get eaten away bit by bit until they are completed.</p>
<p>The biggest trick though is building the habit to write down tasks and even more importantly: refer to your task list on a timely basis.  Its one thing to write something down, its another thing to ensure you go back to that list.  If you can accomplish these two basic tasks, you are on your way to becoming a less stressed and anxious person who is looked upon as being a reliable person who has their sh!t together.</p>
<p>Is one of your problems that you get distracted and can't focus long enough to complete even the simplest tasks?  Try the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>.  Essentially Pomodoro has you assign a block of time to a task.  Any distraction or interruption eats away at your Pomodoro time.  At the end of the time block, if you haven't finished the task at hand, you take a small break and either setup another time block and try to finish the task, or move on to something else.  It makes you less prone to "checking twitter" until it's your break time.</p>
<p>Are you a visual person by nature?  Perhaps the <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/primers/what-is-a-kanban/">Kanban</a> system could help you or your team as a whole.  It has you separate your tasks into "lanes" which indicate the state of a task.  States might include: <em>In Progress</em>, <em>Needs Attention</em>, or the most important state: <strong><em>Done</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What you'll find with a lot of these systems is the overarching theme of "<strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail">Defeat in Detail</a>" in military terms.  I for one am not good with large tasks until I can divide them up into bite size chunks.  It's also a nice mind trick when you start feeling really good about completing those small chunks which comprise a large goal, even if you've only tackled 20% of the whole; it still makes you hungry to tackle more.</p>
<p>A lot of the productivity systems can be implemented using Pen and Paper, one we haven't mentioned is "<a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/">Auto Focus</a>", however there are a bunch of computer programs which have sprung up to help you on your way to productivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> and <a href=" http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things.app</a> for the Getting Things Done system</li>
<li><a href="http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/">Pomodoro Timer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com/">EverNote</a> for collecting random notes and snippets, then organizing them and turning them into tasks later</li>
<li><a href="http://getconcentrating.com/">Concentrate</a> an app which helps you block common distractions like Twitter, Facebook, etc...  Helps when implementing Pomodoro</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, if you are like me and have all your great epiphanies whilst in the Shower and yet have no means write them down, there is a waterproof <a href="http://www.myaquanotes.com/">shower notepad</a> for jotting down those social networking site multi-billion dollar ideas <img src='http://basementcoders.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/marcjeanson">Marc Jeanson</a> who provided many of the links and his great insight on the cast.  Marc's company <a href="http://www.redlinesoftware.com/">Redline Software</a> is creating productivity software which should be released in the near future.  We'll let you know when it launches and get our listeners some sneak-peek beta demos.

Let&#039;s face it, in this business there are two types of people:  Those that deliver and those who don&#039;t.  What you may  not know is that the differentiating factor could be as simple as whether or not a person has a trusted system in place which allows them an easier time at Getting Things Done.

When someone is productive they tend to be goal oriented;  they know what they want to achieve and more importantly how they can go about doing so.  A lot of people think that these achiever-types are just &quot;naturally gifted&quot;, however the only &quot;natural&quot; inclination common amongst them is that completing tasks drives them to achieving goals.  Fear not! This can be learned!  Try it yourself.  Write a simple task list out for Saturday chores (Shovel the walk, get the groceries, fill the tires in the car, etc...).  You&#039;ll find that you start feeling good by not only completing those chores, but also from the sense of accomplishment which comes in crossing them off the list.  That sense of accomplishment you get drives you to do more and the side effect of all this is larger goals get eaten away bit by bit until they are completed.
The biggest trick though is building the habit to write down tasks and even more importantly: refer to your task list on a timely basis.  Its one thing to write something down, its another thing to ensure you go back to that list.  If you can accomplish these two basic tasks, you are on your way to becoming a less stressed and anxious person who is looked upon as being a reliable person who has their sh!t together.
Is one of your problems that you get distracted and can&#039;t focus long enough to complete even the simplest tasks?  Try the Pomodoro technique.  Essentially Pomodoro has you assign a block of time to a task.  Any distraction or interruption eats away at your Pomodoro time.  At the end of the time block, if you haven&#039;t finished the task at hand, you take a small break and either setup another time block and try to finish the task, or move on to something else.  It makes you less prone to &quot;checking twitter&quot; until it&#039;s your break time.
Are you a visual person by nature?  Perhaps the Kanban system could help you or your team as a whole.  It has you separate your tasks into &quot;lanes&quot; which indicate the state of a task.  States might include: In Progress, Needs Attention, or the most important state: Done.
What you&#039;ll find with a lot of these systems is the overarching theme of &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; or &quot;Defeat in Detail&quot; in military terms.  I for one am not good with large tasks until I can divide them up into bite size chunks.  It&#039;s also a nice mind trick when you start feeling really good about completing those small chunks which comprise a large goal, even if you&#039;ve only tackled 20% of the whole; it still makes you hungry to tackle more.
A lot of the productivity systems can be implemented using Pen and Paper, one we haven&#039;t mentioned is &quot;Auto Focus&quot;, however there are a bunch of computer programs which have sprung up to help you on your way to productivity:

OmniFocus and Things.app for the Getting Things Done system
Pomodoro Timer
EverNote for collecting random notes and snippets, then organizing them and turning them into tasks later
Concentrate an app which helps you block common distractions like Twitter, Facebook, etc...  Helps when implementing Pomodoro

And finally, if you are like me and have all your great epiphanies whilst in the Shower and yet have no means write them down, there is a waterproof shower notepad for jotting down those social networking site multi-billion dollar ideas  
Thanks to Marc Jeanson who provided many of the links and his great insight on the cast.  Marc&#039;s company Redline Software is creating productivity software which should be released in the near future.  We&#039;ll let you know when it launches and get our listeners some sneak-peek beta [...]</itunes:summary>

<p>Every employee has wondered what it'd be like to be a contractor at some point.  Maybe even dreamed of being one.  Now reverse the roles and you don't find many Contractors worth their weight dreaming of becoming employees.<br />

<p>A common excuse for Employees when asked "why don't you become a contractor" is that they "like the stability, and a paycheck every two weeks".

Well first off a big Happy New Years from all of the Basement Coders!  We were on hiatus during the month of December but are back full force with brand new episode.</p>
<p>This episode focuses mostly on a concept in Java which, as we have found, is not well understood by some "experienced" Java Devs: Is Java really Pass By Value.  Well of course it is!  The problem however is people don't know what that means when it comes to reference types.  Common rebuttals are "but a function can modify the state of my object!  That's pass by reference!"  Well, no its not <img src='http://basementcoders.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   That's mutability.</p>
<p><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/girlfriendify.png" alt="" title="girlfriendify" width="542" height="113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1282" /><br />
Why are we focusing on such a topic?  Well, over on the "Java Developer" group at LinkedIn, someone asked the seemingly innocent question "<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&#038;gid=70526&#038;type=member&#038;item=29282724&#038;commentID=-1&#038;goback=.gmp_70526#lastComment">Help guys!!! Java supports pass by value or reference?</a>" which has exploded into a 274 message thread of some of the best flaming you've ever seen!  For those who aren't on LinkedIn, or don't want to become a member of the Java Developers group, a new discussion has taken root <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=61622">over at The Server Side</a>.</p>
<p>Other topics we cover are the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">Mac App Store</a> and what this means for the Mac consumer and developer as well as <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_asf_resigns_from_the">Apache's announcement</a> that they are Leaving the JCP and what (if any) ramifications this will have for Oracle and Java.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br />

Also we ask ourselves what exactly can be made of this web-framework matrix which seems to have appeared from the ether at Devoxx 2010 from Matt Raible  We voice our, how do you say... &lt;strong/&gt; opinions on the matter  
And lastly Jeff Genender introduces us to, and demonstrates, a special piece of software which could cost the telemarketing inudstry millions  

Enjoy!

<p>Granted, I did a bit due dillegence prior to Episode 7 via StackOverflow to get <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2951742/why-are-mainframes-still-around">others opinions on the matter</a> but still, my journalistic spidey senses tingled at the fact Episode 7 was a one-sided debate for the most part.</p>
<p>To remedy this, <a href="http://twitter.com/rburton">a friend</a> put us in touch with Mainframe <a href="http://www.craigsmullins.com/">Consultant</a> and <a href="http://www.craigsmullins.com/booklnks.htm">Author</a>: <a href="http://twitter.com/craigmullins">Craig Mullins</a>.  It was an eye opener of a podcast, Mainframes truly haven't lost their "super computer" moniker even in today's advances with cloud computing.</p>
<p>Around the time I was arranging this interview I thought to get in touch with a previous colleague named <a href="http://twitter.com/gsepke">Glen Sepke</a>.  We went to grab a beer and I told him my aforementioned feeling about Episode 7.  He agreed it was too one-sided.  So I offered to have him on the podcast so it wasn't just us against Craig Mullins <img src='http://basementcoders.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So Why Do Mainframes Still Exist?  As "modern developers" we really need to ask these types of questions and get credible answers.   Otherwise, people tend to alienate that which they don't know.  It's why developers (and, yes, I was in this camp), snicker at the term "COBOL" and "Mainframe".  Its because we truly don't understand them, and thus a lot of FUD is created.  Mainframes are perhaps becoming even more relevant now that they can run Java and talk to the outside world via Web Services.</p>
<p>So give this episode a listen and open your mind to allowing Mainframes their rightful place in today's modern computing arena.</p>

Enjoy!</p>

Ever since we did Episode 7 -Why are Mainframes Still Around? we were left with the realization that really all the podcast involved was a bunch of non-mainframe programmers making speculations about why the dinosaurs didn&#039;t become extinct in our world?
Granted, I did a bit due dillegence prior to Episode 7 via StackOverflow to get others opinions on the matter but still, my journalistic spidey senses tingled at the fact Episode 7 was a one-sided debate for the most part.
To remedy this, a friend put us in touch with Mainframe Consultant and Author: Craig Mullins.  It was an eye opener of a podcast, Mainframes truly haven&#039;t lost their &quot;super computer&quot; moniker even in today&#039;s advances with cloud computing.

<p>While at <a href="http://devconnections.com">Dev Connections</a> 2010 I had the privilege to interview <strong>Shaun Walker</strong> the creator and founder of <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> (or DNN for short), a .NET based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Content Management System</a> (CMS).   Content Management Systems typically allow non-technical people (i.e. Marketing personnel) to build websites like Lego with content being the pieces.  They are very popular among corporations, and even this site uses <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> which can be considered a CMS for bloggers.</p>
<p>Other CMSs you might know are <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://www.day.com/">Adobe CQ</a> and <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/">Alfresco</a>.</p>
<p>I sat down with Shaun not knowing a heck of a lot about him or the history of DNN and was pleasantly informed that DNN started out life as an Open Source software systems that grew into an Open Core/Dual Licensed flagship product.  It's nice to see this model in play in the .NET world, I hadn't heard of too many .NET based projects which have gone this route.</p>
<p>Shaun was a great guest, even if you aren't into .NET or CMSs you should give the cast a listen, I doubt you'll be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Networking Event</h3>
<p style="padding-top:1em;">
One other thing I should mention is the hospitality DNN extended to me.  They were throwing a party and gave me and my friends from <a href="http://apptius.com/">Apptius Computer Solutions</a> free invites.  The party was a blast, and they gave away over 20 prizes of which one of my friend's won a copy of <a href="http://store.microsoft.com/microsoft/Visual-Studio-2010-Ultimate-with-MSDN/product/6DE912FF">Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate edition with MSDN</a> ( a paltry $11,899 value) and another friend won a DNN plugin pack.</p>
<p>Got to meet a lot of great people including all the DNN Corp folks.  I talked to a number of DNN customers and they all seemed pleased with the product and the people behind DNN.</p>
<p>Thanks again DNNCorp!

Our very own Basement Coder Justin Lee arranged for an interview with the creators of the <a href="http://fantom.org">Fantom language</a>: Andy and Brian Frank.  It's no coincidence the Frank's share the same last name, they are indeed brothers who work at their own company called <a href="http://skyfoundry.com/">Sky Foundry</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from Justin, the rest of the Basement Coders hadn't heard of Fantom.  Justin assured us it would be worth looking into, and after a cursory glance we all decided that yes, we want to interview these fellows!</p>
<p>When I started looking into Fantom I immediately was struck with the notion of "If Java were to have progressed in both language features and syntax, this is what it would look like".  That's because Fantom looks very Java-like and also runs on the JVM or .NET CLR, so you can leverage all your existing code!  Given this, Fantom's approachability factor is much higher than <a href="http://basementcoders.com/2010/09/episode-16-scala-and-akka-an-inteview-with-jonas-boner/">Scala</a> in that a Java/.NET programmer can look at it and immediately know what's happening.  Scala has a bit more of an "alien" syntax for Java/.NET developers, and it's tough to just "jump into" Scala code without first researching the language and its features.</p>
<p>So take Java, add syntax for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">Closures</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">Mixins</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_binding_%28computer_science%29">Dynamic Method Binding</a> and you have Fantom. For these reasons alone you should do yourself a favour and<a href="http://fantom.org/doc/docIntro/Tour.html"> take a look at it</a>, if you like what you see, get the word out to your friends and collegues and help Brian and Andy grow the community and the language itself.</p>

<p>Now, what about mobile applications?  A big trend in Mobile apps is to make the application running on the Phone (or other mobile device) act simply as a presentation tier.  All the heavy lifting and data representation is done via a web service running on a server which the mobile app communicates with.  Elastic Search can be spun up on a server and instantly you have a service your mobile app can communicate with to store and retrieve data in a simple to use fashion.</p>

<p>Do you know what the <a href="http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/entry/let_larry_know_you_care" target="_blank">Free Java movement</a> is?  It's not exactly cut-and-dry.  Essentially it's a movement which wants more community rather than autocratic involvement in the direction of Java.  It seems that Oracle is shaping the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process">JCP</a> with <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html" target="_blank">less focus on individuals </a>and seemingly more focus on "<a href="http://blog.crazybob.org/2010/10/long-live-java.html" target="_blank">Friends of Oracle</a>" (or Friends of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difference-Between-God-Larry-Ellison/dp/0060008768" target="_blank">Larry</a>, if there's even a distinction).</p>
<p>All of this and the fact that Apple, without warning (or provocation that we know of) decided to<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010380-CH4-SW1" target="_blank"> deprecate Java on Mac OSX</a>. The more disturbing part is Oracle's complete "head in the sand" non-reaction to this news.  Essentially, we don't know what the future of Java is on Mac OSX, especially in light of how <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/oracle-sues-google-over-java-use-in-android-852" target="_blank">lawsuit happy Oracle has been</a> these days.</p>
<p>Even more interesting than the article itself are the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/can-oracle-save-java#view_62003">comments</a> made by an Oracle employee (and the criticisms which follow) on InfoQ's "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/can-oracle-save-java" target="_blank">Can Oracle turn around Java?</a>".</p>

<strong>Edit: The transcript can be found <a href="http://basementcoders.com/?p=788">here</a></strong></p>

</div>
<p>
Once again we present another special Basement Coders podcast Live from Oracle's JavaOne conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We sit down with Oracle's <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/">Justin Kestelyn</a> head of Oracle's <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html">OTN network</a> and <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/">Henrik Stahl</a>, product and strategy lead for Java Platform technologies to talk about the challenges they faced integrating the Oracle and Java communities and Oracle's commitment and goals for Java and the Open Source community</p>
<p>We think this makes for a nice contrast with our previous talk with James Gosling.  If Justin, Henrik and Oracle can deliver on what is said in this cast, then Java is in good hands.  It was great that both Henrik and Justin could take time out of their busy schedules, I mean quite literally JavaOne for them is an absolute roller coaster ride, so we appreciate very much the opportunity to talk with them.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As with our previous cast, this one was taped guerrila-style from the Mason St. Tent. For the most part it's ok, but from <strong>11:36-15:18</strong> minutes, you'll hear the Google lady get on her microphone to prod geeks into playing with Lego.  Someone should have told her: you don't need a microphone to get geeks to play with Lego!  Wait out the background noise and things go back to normal.  </p>
<div style="width: 90%; border: thick double black;padding:10px;margin-left:25px;">
Before you accuse us of using "kid gloves" or skirting the real issues surrounding Oracle and Java it should be known that we had an Oracle PR chaperon overseeing the cast (you can see her in the pic below).  It's why you won't hear the words "Google", "JCP" or "lawsuit" anywhere in this cast.  That being said, we tried to get answers for the Open Source community as to the direction Oracle is taking things.

Once again we present another special Basement Coders podcast Live from Oracle&#039;s JavaOne conference in San Francisco.
We sit down with Oracle&#039;s Justin Kestelyn head of Oracle&#039;s OTN network and Henrik Stahl, product and strategy lead for Java Platform technologies to talk about the challenges they faced integrating the Oracle and Java communities and Oracle&#039;s commitment and goals for Java and the Open Source community
We think this makes for a nice contrast with our previous talk with James Gosling.  If Justin, Henrik and Oracle can deliver on what is said in this cast, then Java is in good hands.  It was great that both Henrik and Justin could take time out of their busy schedules, I mean quite literally JavaOne for them is an absolute roller coaster ride, so we appreciate very much the opportunity to talk with them.

Enjoy!
Note: As with our previous cast, this one was taped guerrila-style from the Mason St. Tent. For the most part it&#039;s ok, but from 11:36-15:18 minutes, you&#039;ll hear the Google lady get on her microphone to prod geeks into playing with Lego.  Someone should have told her: you don&#039;t need a microphone to get geeks to play with Lego!  Wait out the background noise and things go back to normal.  

Before you accuse us of using &quot;kid gloves&quot; or skirting the real issues surrounding Oracle and Java it should be known that we had an Oracle PR chaperon overseeing the cast (you can see her in the pic below).  It&#039;s why you won&#039;t hear the words &quot;Google&quot;, &quot;JCP&quot; or &quot;lawsuit&quot; anywhere in this cast.  That being said, we tried to get answers for the Open Source community as to the direction Oracle is taking things.  I think Henrik and Justin did a great job, they seem very committed to Java&#039;s future.

<img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gosling_polaroid.png" alt="James Gosling" title="James Gosling" class="alignright size-full" />Picture a Sunday Evening, you've just arrived from where ever you hail from to San Francisco.  You got up at some ungodly hour to catch your flight, only to learn its been delayed 2 hours.  Once you arrive catch the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> to your hotel, and come to realize "yeah, even two hours difference in timezone does add up".  You have to put on your game-face though, there are Mai Tais to be drunk at the <a href="http://www.tongaroom.com/">Tonga Room</a>, and there are <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html">JavaOne</a> "after parties" to hit.</p>
<p>The After Party circuit is a key sub-layer to the conference experience.  Even if you aren't connected, you can still get into these "who's who" showcases as a lot of the partners open them up to anyone who registers on their respective websites.</p>
<p>For instance, our first after-party was the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a> party which took place at a favourite haunt of the Basement Coders called "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=the+thirsty+bear+san+francisco&#038;fb=1&#038;gl=us&#038;hq=the+thirsty+bear&#038;hnear=San+Francisco,+CA&#038;cid=16117366048065422338">The Thirsty Bear</a>". The beer there is just spectacular. These after-parties are a great way to meet people you might never have talked to outside of a mailing list. Beer greases all social wheels.</p>
<p><img src="http://basementcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/bcoders_gosling_polaroid.png" alt="James Gosling and The Basement Coders" title="James Gosling and The Basement Coders" class="alignleft size-full" />About a half hour into our libations in walks a legend: <a href="http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/">James Gosling</a>, creator of Java itself.  Nervously, but keeping our cool, we approached and introduced ourselves.  We left it at that. As the beers flowed, our courage and machinations began too as well.  "What if, now just what if, we could get Gosling to do a cast?"  But doubting thoughts prevailed: "Nah we aren't big enough" "Do we really want to disturb a guy drinking his beer?"  Quickly some of the Coder's wives keyed into our anxiety over the issue.  Wanting to play match maker, they approached James and asked him if he'd be willing to do a podcast with us. And wouldn't you know it, he whipped out his iPhone (yay James!), opened his calendar and said "Sure! What works for you guys?"  Speechless.</p>
<p>Have a good long listen to our coffee-shop interview with James Gosling.  It's an unfiltered and organic talk with a legend of our craft.  A Coder's Coder, and an all around great guy.  If you like what you hear, why not buy <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/OrcOmit">one of his T-shirts</a> and support the Free Java movement?</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> We'll try to work on the quality of cast and filter out more of the background noise.  <a href="http://theserverside.com/">The Server Side</a> has offered to transcribe the cast, so stay tuned for a link to that.  If you know any audio processing tricks, please let us know!  We also have other related media which we'll post soon.</p>

So no more restarting Tomcat or Jetty when you change your underlying source code!  Very very cool stuff.

No, it appears we have a new name: he's been "Google'd" - release a product then abandon it.  That reminds me...

This week we grill our very own expert <a href="http://www.antwerkz.com/grizzly-and-websockets/">Justin Lee</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets">Web Sockets</a>.  We ask what they are, how they are being used and how they'll change the web to come.  Justin works on the <a href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/">Grizzly Web Sockets</a> project, take a look, experiment with it and create something cool!</p>
<p>In this episode we've started a news segment.  We grabbed two of the DZone Big Links of the day which caught our eye.  The topics were "<a href="http://www.lessonsoffailure.com/companies/outsourcing-cost-lie/">The Outsourcing Low Cost Lie</a>" and how the popular free text editor <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is leaving Source Forge over its policies concerning countries on a US blacklist.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Came under a bit of fire from one listener for my position on Offshoring/Outsourcing.  It should be known (if not clear in the podcast) that I'm targeting the companies that plant Junior devs masquerading as Senior ones.  People in other parts of the world are just as smart and talented than ones in North America, but just as it is here there are a lot of bad or inexperienced ones too.  You can keep those ones mkaythxwtfbbq.  In the next podcast I'll defend my position and hopefully you'll see I'm not anti-world-developers.  I'm sure the other Basement Coders will share their experience and points of view as well.</p>

<p>The topic for the podcast is a question I'm sure you've asked several times yourself: "Why are mainframes still around?".  What makes them attractive, even today?  Who maintains these systems in 10 years when the 50-somethings have retired?  Is Cloud Computing the chainsaw-shotgun we've been waiting for or is SOA the "brains" that keep zombie mainframe code alive and well?</p>

In this episode we have a special guest, Jason Whaley who along with Jeff Genender have a plethora of SOA and Cloud Computing knowledge and insight.  If you were in Las Vegas last March at TSSJS you&#039;ve no doubt heard them speak.
The topic for the podcast is a question I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve asked several times yourself: &quot;Why are mainframes still around?&quot;.  What makes them attractive, even today?  Who maintains these systems in 10 years when the 50-somethings have retired?  Is Cloud Computing the chainsaw-shotgun we&#039;ve been waiting for or is SOA the &quot;brains&quot; that keep zombie mainframe code alive and well?

<p>Our third episode is about a topic near and dear to every developer: what editor to develop with and why it's far superior than the piece of crap someone else uses.  Alex, Craig and Marc  chat about everything from Eclipse/Textmate to vim/emacs.  It's a sensitive topic for most, and we went into this podcast knowing we wouldn't convince each other to stray from our weapon of choice, but we managed to fill about 45 minutes discussing some of the finer points of editing and being productive.</p>
<p>I think this podcast - more so than the others - represents most accurately three developers sitting around drinking beer and talking shop.  When we go out to the pub (sadly) this is exactly the type of conversation we (and if you've made it to the third episode, probably you too) have.</p>
