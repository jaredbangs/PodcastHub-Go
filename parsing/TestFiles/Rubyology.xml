Get ready for an awesome two-track Ruby conference with an all-star presenter cast starting tomorrow (8/11) in Austin, Tx - The LoneStar RubyConf! This is @LSRC's fifth consecutive year so these guys really know how to throw a conference. John Dyer will be onsite representing Tropo, the leading cloud and VoIP communications company. He will be running a hackathon for developing cool apps using either the Tropo Voice and SMS API or the Phono VoIP web phone or the SMSified API. Tropo will be giving away Production credits as well as a Parrot AR Drone (iPhone controlled quatra-copter)! Good luck everyone!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>ruby,rails,ruby,on,rails,programming,web,2,0,rubyology</itunes:keywords></item>

In this talk, we'll create our own gem from scratch, using only things that are provided by Ruby, its standard library, and RubyGems to craft a simple gem. You'll learn how to set up a project, how to write and run tests, how to use Rake to quickly build the gem, and even how to create a gem that installs an executable command-line program." />

      <title>Rubyology 85: Teleku, cloud telecom</title>
      <itunes author="Chris Matthieu" />
      <itunes subtitle="Chris Matthieu introduces his new cloud-based telecom start-up written in Ruby on Rails called Teleku.com!  Teleku is a new cloud-based telecom service that allows Web developers to build and host phone applications that answer inbound calls and initiate outbound calls, interact with Web applications, and send/receive SMS text messages! Using simple XML and JSON responses in your HTTP Web pages, you can deliver sophisticated interactive voice response (IVR) telephony applications in as little as 5 minutes!  The Teleku platform runs phone applications written in PhoneMLÂ®, Twilioâ€™sÂ® TwiMLÂ®, and traditional VoiceXML. You can even mix XML libraries on a Web service call-by-call basis and chain voice applets together using one or all of the three libraries.  Teleku natively uses Phone Markup Language (PhoneML) to build powerful phone applications quickly and easily. PhoneML can be viewed as a modern and more simple approach to building XML/JSON-based telephony applications. PhoneML is a set of RESTful XML/JSON commands that allow developers to build simple yet sophisticated phone applications using any Web programming language. We mask the complexities of building a traditional voice application by providing you with a easy Web Service API that handles the complex telco services and even Speech Recognition (ASR) grammar development.  Telekuâ€™s API does not require you to purchase an SDK or download software but rather provides free RESTful Web Services that allow your Web applications to receive telephone, Skype, and SIP calls to interact with callers over the telephone like traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems by playing MP3, WAV, or VOX media files, speaking text-to-speech (TTS) prompts, collecting digits and spoken commands through speech recognition (ASR), recording audio, dialing numbers, transferring calls, etc.  Teleku is hosted in the cloud (specifically Amazonâ€™s EC2 platform) allowing us to scale your phone application from one to thousands of simultaneous calls in the blink of an eye!

      <description>Chris Matthieu interviewed Jay Phillips, the founder of the Adhearsion project.  Adhearsion is an open source framework that, in simplest terms, improves the way the world writes "voice" applications. It rests above a popular open-source platform called Asterisk, abstracting its many pain points and domain complexity.  This framework turns Ruby developers into telecom engineers.

Jay's blog is http://jicksta.com/ and his project can be found at http://adhearsion.pbwiki.com/ or http://github.com/jicksta/adhearsion/tree/master

We also covered VoIP, SIP, IAX, and Erlang!  Hope you enjoy the interview!</description>
