      <title>Interview with Trevor Burnham on CoffeeScript</title>
      <description>CoffeeScript burst onto the scene at the end of 2009, and is beginning to show up everywhere. Ruby on Rails now ships with it as the default way to write JavaScript, and even Brendan Eich (the creator of JavaScript) has mentioned CoffeeScript as an influence on the future of JavaScript. What’s all the fuss about? Is CoffeeScript just hype, or is there really something to it?

Trevor Burnham literally wrote the book on CoffeeScript. In this PragCast interview we talk to him about the “human-friendly dialect of JavaScript,” what it is, where it’s going, and how CoffeeScript can actually make you a better JavaScript programmer.

      <title>The Future of Web Development</title>
      <description>HTML5 and CSS3 are the future of web development, and in this episode of the pragmatic podcast, Brian Hogan talks about his new book "HTML5 and CSS3: Develop with Tomorrow's Standards Today".

HTML5 is quickly becoming a marketing term, a new buzzword with a fancy logo that may put some people off. Is this a good or bad thing? Are there features in HTML5/CSS3 that make adopting these technologies now worth the effort? Brian even tackles the HTML5 vs Flash debate, and answers the question "Is Flash dead?".

      <title>Johanna Rothman Interview, with Ian Dees</title>
      <description>Miles Forrest talks about multitasking and getting things done with Johanna Rothman and Ian Dees.

Everyone manages time, whether you keep it all in your head, write it down on paper, or enter it in some form of electronic organizer. But what do you do when you have a really big project? What do you do when you say "I want to do it all!" but end up going nowhere fast?  Author Johanna Rothman shares techniques that work.

Johanna began managing projects back in 1984 when there was no Internet, no voice mail, and tools like spreadsheets had just been invented. As she grew in her abilities to manage large, complicated projects with hundreds of developers, she branched out, working as a consultant for the last 16 years.  Her most recent book, "Managing You Project Portfolio", helps you organize multiple projects and evaluate them without getting buried under a mountain of statistics.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Rasmusson Interview</title>
      <description>Jonathan Rasmusson discusses his new book "The Agile Samurai: How Agile Masters Deliver Great Software". As a former evangelist for ThoughtWorks, Jonathan brings a real world, hands-covered-in-muck approach to the subject of Agile development. What is Agile, really? And not from a theoretical point of view, but from the trenches? What works? What doesn't? How do you get started? Although "exciting" might not be a word most people think of when discussing software development, Jonathan's energy and infectious enthusiasm is apparent on this interview with host Miles Forrest.</description>

      <title>Robert Martin interview</title>
      <description>In this episode, your host Miles Forrest interviews Robert Martin, know by many as "Uncle Bob."  Bob has been slinging code for 40 years, and still loves coding.  As Bob puts it, "I want to code till I die and I don't want to die soon."

Bob reveals his thoughts on the craft of programming and hopes for the next computer language, including the solution to the Moore's Law dilemma that dates back to 1957.  He'll describe the right way to write a framework (hint: don't _write_ it) and discuss current problems and opportunities with agile development methods.

Discover the *Most Horrible Invention* in the last twenty years (and possibly the most popular!) and what Bob thinks about experience, mentorship and science fiction.</description>

      <title>Stuart Halloway on Programming Clojure</title>
      <description>Stuart Halloway, author of "Programming Clojure", tells Susannah Pfalzer all about this new and cool programming language.  Stuart explains how Clojure helps you move beyond noun-based programming toward verb-based programming, and why pure functions are important for concurrency.  It's a lot of Lisp, but with Less parentheses--even fewer than Java itself.  See how to be more expressive on the Java VM, and how Clojure is different from Scala and Groovy.

      <itunes:summary>Stuart Halloway, author of "Programming Clojure", tells Susannah Pfalzer all about this new and cool programming language.  Stuart explains how Clojure helps you move beyond noun-based programming toward verb-based programming, and why pure functions are important for concurrency.  It's a lot of Lisp, but with Less parentheses--even fewer than Java itself.  See how to be more expressive on the Java VM, and how Clojure is different from Scala and Groovy.

Frustrated with proprietary, difficult scripting languages, or fragile, coordinate-based systems, Ian describes how GUI testing with Ruby is such a pleasure.  Ian's new book gives you the actual techniques to take control of this window or that drop-down list--without hard-coded data.  Ian describes his use of rSpec, randomized and matrix testing, writing stories for testing, and more.</description>
