<p>&ldquo;After receiving hundreds of inquiries, stacks of video submissions and a very close audition race, one smile, one funny and sincere delivery became our standout favorite -- Alfonso Ribeiro,&rdquo; said Vin Di Bona, executive producer. &ldquo;We look forward to Alfonso leading AFV into the next generation of family friendly viewership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following the home invasion murder of Matt Skokie &ndash;&nbsp;a war vet &ndash;&nbsp;and an assault on his wife Gwen, four suspects are brought into custody: <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/tony-gutierrez"><strong>Tony Guti&eacute;rrez</strong></a>, an impressionable teen who got in way over his head even under the watchful eye of his dedicated and hard-working father, <strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/2-alonzo-gutierrez">Alonzo Guti&eacute;rrez</a></strong>. <strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/hector-tontz">Hector Tontz</a></strong>, a young man who has lived life on the fringes of society and has made bad decisions just to survive. Carter Nix and Aubry Taylor, two incredibly lost souls whose addiction to drugs and to one another has become destructive and paralyzing.</p>
<p>Though the suspects fit a profile, they and their situations are far more complicated than anyone would have initially believed... As is true for the victims themselves. As <strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/russ-skokie">Russ&nbsp;Skokie</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/barb-hanlon"><strong>Barb Hanlon</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; divorced and estranged &ndash;&nbsp;arrive to both bury their son Matt, and seek a measure of justice for his killing, they discover their son may have been far from an innocent bystander in his own murder.</p>
<p>Told from the points of view of all those involved, this new drama examines preconceptions on faith, family, gender, race, class and other aspects of our social experience with an approach and perspectives historically underserved in media.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime"><em>American Crime</em></a>&nbsp;</strong>stars Felicity Huffman as Barb Hanlon, Timothy Hutton as Russ Skokie, W. Earl Brown as <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/2-tom-carlin"><strong>Tom Carlin</strong></a>, Richard Cabral as Hector Tontz, Caitlin Gerard as Aubry Taylor, Benito Martinez as Alonzo Guti&eacute;rrez, Penelope Ann Miller as <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/american-crime/cast/eve-carlin"><strong>Eve Carlin</strong></a>, Elvis Nolasco as Carter Nix, Johnny Ortiz as Tony Guti&eacute;rrez and guest starring Regina King as Aliyah Shadeed.</p>

Who will the men prefer? Eventually, only one woman will be left to hand out the final rose. <i>The Bachelorette</i> returns to ABC, premiering <b>MONDAY,</b> <b>MAY 18</b> (9:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network.</p>
<p>It was the hug felt around the world. And no one will ever forget it. When stunning Britt Nilsson pulled up at the Bachelor Mansion and approached Chris, she was trembling with nervous anticipation. Moments later, she found herself in an embrace that captured both Chris&rsquo; and the country&rsquo;s heart. Later that night, Chris confirmed the intensity of that embrace when he handed Britt the coveted first impression rose. And with that, a love affair began to blossom.</p>
<p>As Chris&rsquo;s journey evolved, no one&mdash;certainly none of the other girls&mdash;could deny the connection between Britt and the handsome farmer. Their kisses were passionate, their conversations intimate. However, what seemed like true love all came to a screeching halt just before hometown dates. Britt&rsquo;s dream of finding a husband was shattered. She left in tears, returning to her hometown in Michigan to mend her heart with her loving family by her side.</p>
<p>Born just outside Detroit, Michigan, Britt eventually moved to Los Angeles to attend college at Azusa Pacific University. After school, she stayed in California, moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in modeling. After giving up modeling, Britt worked as a waitress, spreading her infectious personality while serving others. She also began volunteering at a local church, where you can often find her greeting congregants at the door.</p>
<p>Since she left the show, America just can&rsquo;t stop talking about Britt &ndash; and she is back and determined to find the elusive, true love she has been looking for her entire life. She knows that this process worked once for her, and she can&rsquo;t wait to give it another go.</p>
<p>And then there is Kaitlyn Bristowe. Millions watched in quiet astonishment when Chris explained to a heartbroken Kaitlyn that she was not the woman with whom he would be spending the rest of his life. Her eyes brimming with tears, she stepped inside a waiting car to head back to her single life.</p>
<p>Kaitlyn is truly one of a kind. She&rsquo;s beautiful, irreverent, and undeniably hilarious. In the past, however, her playful demeanor has often kept her from opening up and being vulnerable to love. It was her experience on the Bachelor that helped her finally tap into that part of her heart that had been dormant for so long. Even though she went home without the love she was so desperately looking for, Kaitlyn is thankful for her time with Chris. And now&mdash;more than ever&mdash;she is ready to let down those walls and find love again.</p>
<p>The daughter of a ballerina, Kaitlyn&rsquo;s love of dance took hold at a very young age, and she hasn&rsquo;t stopped moving since, neither figuratively nor literally. Currently, she teaches spin classes. However, Kaitlyn&rsquo;s ready to trade in the cycling shoes and the gym for a pair of sparkly high heels and a house near the Bachelor mansion. Viewers were thankful for the laughs and smiles she gave them along the way, as her electric personality and indelible sense of humor lit up the screen each week. Kaitlyn was a huge fan favorite from the beginning, and remains so to this day. She is one hundred percent certain that this is the way she is going to find her husband, and wants everyone to share this once-in-a-lifetime ride with her.</p></span></section></div></article><article class="item"><div class="imageContainer"><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/battlebots" title="BattleBots"><img class="replaceable" src="http://static.east.abc.go.com/service/image/index/id/be898432-e0b3-4f60-991e-7dbc73a88186/dim/16x9.png" alt="loading" data-properties='{"image":{"src":"92115c5f-e706-4a85-9893-94e15201793a","alt":"BattleBots"}}' />BattleBots</a><section class="tuneInBar"><span class="description hidden"><p>ABC has picked up&nbsp;<a href="../../../../shows/battlebots"><strong><em>BattleBots</em></strong></a>, a reimagined take of the killer robot combat sport from Whalerock Industries and the creators of the original&nbsp;<em>BattleBots</em>&nbsp;franchise, Ed Roski and Greg Munson.

She's also everything you don't expect - sexy, glamorous, unpredictable and dangerous. As fearless in the courtroom as she is in the classroom, Annalise is a defense attorney who represents the most hardened, violent criminals - people who've committed everything from fraud to arson to murder - and she'll do almost anything to win their freedom. On the surface, Annalise seems like she has it all - a successful career and loving husband, Sam (Tom Verica) - but her relationship with a local Philadelphia detective, Nate (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/nate">Billy Brown</a></strong>), will force her to confront secrets about her life she never saw coming.</p>
<p>Each year, Annalise selects a group of the smartest, most promising students to come work at her law firm. The students vying for this coveted position include Wes Gibbins (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/wes-gibbins">Alfred Enoch</a></strong>), a wide-eyed, likable boy-next-door recently accepted off the waitlist; Michaela Pratt (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/michaela-pratt">Aja Naomi King</a></strong>), a confident, ambitious overachiever born knowing how to "lean in;" Connor Walsh (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/connor-walsh">Jack Falahee</a></strong>), a sly, sophisticated heartbreaker used to getting any prize he lays his eyes on; Laurel Castillo (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/laurel-castillo">Karla Souza</a></strong>), a quiet, sensitive idealist who's easy to underestimate and Asher Millstone (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/asher-millstone">Matt McGorry</a></strong>), an entitled know-it-all born into a world of Ivy League educations and country club memberships. The students all work under two of Annalise's dedicated associates: Frank Delfino (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/frank-delfino">Charlie Weber</a></strong>), a local Philly boy done good, and Bonnie Winterbottom (<strong><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/bonnie-winterbottom">Liza Weil</a></strong>), a sweet, observant team-player with a hidden edge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Early in the first season, Wes will become entangled with his mysterious neighbor, Rebecca (<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/rebecca"><strong>Katie Findlay</strong></a>), after she becomes the main suspect in the murder of a beautiful university coed. Annalise's involvement with Rebecca's case will challenge her students' values, convictions, and dreams, as she teaches them the dark truth about the law and our justice system. It's worth it though. Working for Annalise is the opportunity of a lifetime, one that can change the course of our students' lives forever, which is exactly what happens when they find themselves involved in a murder plot that will rock the entire university.</p>

<p>It's 1946 and peace has dealt Peggy a serious blow as she finds herself marginalized when the men return home from fighting abroad. Working for the covert SSR (Strategic Scientific Reserve), Peggy finds herself stuck doing administrative work when she would rather be back out in the field &mdash;&nbsp;putting her vast skills into play and taking down the bad guys.

<p>When old acquaintance <b>Howard Stark</b> (Dominic Cooper, <em>Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger</em>) finds himself being framed for unleashing his deadliest weapons to anyone willing to pony up the cash, he contacts Peggy &mdash;&nbsp;the only person he can trust &mdash;&nbsp;to track down those responsible, dispose of the weapons and clear his name. He empowers his butler, <b>Edwin Jarvis</b> (James D'Arcy, <em>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</em>), to be at her beck and call when needed to help assist her as she investigates and tracks down those responsible for releasing these weapons of mass destruction. But Jarvis, who is a creature of habit and sticks to a rigid daily routine, is going to have to make some major life changes if he's going to be able to keep up with Peggy.</p>
<p>If caught going on these secret missions for Stark, Peggy could be targeted as a traitor and spend the rest of her days in prison &mdash;&nbsp;or worse.

She has a fling with Ward, who happens to be a spy for the evil organization known as HYDRA. Ward is loyal to Garrett, who turns out to be the Clairvoyant.</p>
<p>A massive battle takes place and S.H.I.E.L.D. is completely dismantled. HYDRA has been infiltrating the organization for years.

<p><strong><a href="../../../../shows/mistresses/episode-guide/season-01">Season 1</a></strong>: Savannah ("Savi") is a successful career woman working toward the next phase in her life -- both professionally and personally -- bucking for partner at the law firm where she works while also trying to start a family with her husband, Harry. They've been trying to get pregnant for some time, but when their fertility issues begin to take center stage, Savi finds herself attracted to her flirtatious colleague, Dominic.</p>
<p>Savi's free-spirited and capricious baby sister, Josslyn ("Joss"), couldn't be more different, living single, serial dating and partying, and regularly leaning on her big sister. A real estate agent, Josslyn has no interest in a committed, long-term relationship.</p>
<p>Their common best friend, April, is a recent widow and mother of a ten-year-old daughter. In the effort to rebuild her life and move forward, April opens a shop for home decorating. After she receives her late husband's lucrative life insurance check, she begins getting prank phone calls and tells her closest girlfriends that she's convinced her husband is still alive.</p>
<p>Karen is a therapist with her own thriving practice, reconnecting with the girls after her involvement in a complicated relationship with a wealthy, married patient goes too far; she was having an affair with a terminally ill client to whom she had prescribed morphine. After his death, the man's distraught son, Sam, confides in a guilt-ridden Karen, unaware of her role in his father's life. The grieving widow, Elizabeth Grey (recurring guest star Penelope Ann Miller [<em>The Artist</em>]), has no idea her late husband had a romance with another woman.</p>
<p>These four friends find support and guidance with each other as they brave their turbulent journeys and life's storms of excitement, secrecy and betrayal, all the while bound by the complex relationships they've created. See the <strong><a href="../../../../shows/mistresses/episode-guide/season-01">Season 1 Episode Guide</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../shows/mistresses/episode-guide/season-02"><strong>Season 2:</strong></a> The second season begins eight months after Savi survived a harrowing car crash. She officially moved away from Harry and onto Dom. Savi is forced to share an office with sexy, boisterous Toni, who has an agenda. She enters into a friendship with Zack, the driver of the car that crashed into her. The two of them share a bond of survival. As for Dom, he joins forces with Savi to expose the scheming Toni to the rest of the law firm, but their relationship is still pretty much over.</p>
<p>After the death of Sam Grey, Karen takes on a patient, Anna, who leads a double life as escort. She begins using assumed names to have one night stands with men she picks up in bars. Karen later dates her former business partner, Jacob, who actually dated Anna. This little love triangle eventually evaporates. Anna returns to her home country and Jacob moves to Boston. As for Karen, she fears her bout with promiscuousness may have led to her being HIV-positive. She&rsquo;s not sick, but the doctor does have other news for her.</p>
<p>April hooks up with &ldquo;sexy smoldering&rdquo; artist Daniel. Things are hot and heavy until the truth about the mystery man comes out. Daniel is with the FBI. He&rsquo;s part of a team trying to bring in the criminals associated with April&rsquo;s ex-hubby, Paul. Dom gets the feds to stop strong-arming April. Daniel is fired from the FBI, but ends up protecting April from the mob men who ultimately kill Paul.</p>
<p>Joss strikes up a business partnership with Harry, who agrees to be caterer in her party planning business. She also begins a relationship with plastic surgeon Scott, who is really into women&rsquo;s shoes. The doc doesn&rsquo;t wear them, he just loans them to the ladies he beds. Joss and Scott get engaged, but the bride-to-be wrestles with some undeniable feelings she has for Harry. These feelings come to a head on her wedding day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pritchett-Dunphy-Tucker clan is a wonderfully large and blended family with Jay Pritchett sitting at the head. By his side is his young, vivacious second wife Gloria, who resists his old-fashioned ways -- an impulse that will become all the more interesting now that he and Gloria have a new baby of their own. This exciting addition will bring more adventures to the family just as Gloria's son, Manny, is about to embark on an adventure of his own as he enters high school. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, also have their son, Luke, heading to high school; their middle daughter, Alex, is full steam ahead on the college track, and the eldest, Haley, is back home figuring out her future. With the kids all growing up, this new chapter means Claire can explore returning to the workforce, which will have its fair share of missteps and victories. And this will be a big year for Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, who alongside his loving partner, Cameron, and daughter Lily, will have a lot of reasons to celebrate. Together these three families give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family.<br /><br /></p>

It's filled with magic, monsters and all of the characters we all know from stories growing up. It's real, and so are the people in it. But unlike the "happily ever after" you may have heard about, their stories continued, and The Evil Queen cast a Dark Curse over the land....</p>
<p>This is Storybrooke. It's a quiet, little, New England town filled with people who go about their everyday lives with no idea who they really are. The Queen's Curse has trapped them here and placed her in near-complete control. They have no real memories and no real hope.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><em>Once Upon A Time</em> is, at its core, a story about hope.</p>
<p><em>"For us, that&rsquo;s what a fairy tale is. It&rsquo;s that ability to think your life will get better. It&rsquo;s why you buy a lottery ticket&mdash;because if you win you get to tell your boss that you&rsquo;re quitting and you get to move to Paris or wherever and be who you always wanted to be. And that&rsquo;s Cinderella, right? One day she&rsquo;s sweeping up and the next she&rsquo;s going to the ball. Adam and I just wanted to write about something hopeful that for one hour a week allows one to put everything aside and have that feeling that your dreams just may come true."</em><br />- Edward Kitsis, Co-Creator/Executive Producer</p>
<p><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/episode-guide/season-01"><strong>About Season 1:</strong></a> Emma Swan&rsquo;s life has been anything but a fairytale. A 28-year-old bail bondsperson, she&rsquo;s been taking care of herself since she was abandoned as a baby. But when Henry&mdash;the son she gave up 10 years ago&mdash;finds her, everything changes. Henry is desperate for his mom&rsquo;s help and thinks that Emma is actually the long, lost daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Yes, the actual Snow White and Prince Charming. Even stranger, Henry believes that Storybrooke, the sleepy New England town he calls home, is really part of a curse cast by the Evil Queen, freezing fairytale characters in the modern world with no memory of their former selves.</p>
<p>Of course the seen-it-all Emma doesn&rsquo;t believe a word, but when she gets to Storybrooke, she can&rsquo;t help sensing that everything&rsquo;s not quite what it seems. As Henry shows Emma around with the help of his fairytale book, the town, and its inhabitants like Henry&rsquo;s therapist Archie Hopper and the enigmatic Mr. Gold, seem just strange enough to set off her already suspicious nature. She becomes even more concerned for Henry when she meets his adopted mother, Regina, who he suspects is none other than the Evil Queen herself!</p>
<p>Storybrooke is a place where magic has been forgotten&mdash;but is still powerfully close&mdash;and happily ever after seems just out of reach. In order to understand where the fairytale world&rsquo;s former inhabitants came from, and what ultimately led to the Evil Queen&rsquo;s wrath, you&rsquo;ll need a glimpse into their previous lives. But it might just turn everything you&rsquo;ve ever believed about these characters upside-down. Meanwhile, the epic battle for the future of all worlds, modern and fairytale alike, is about to begin. For good to win, Emma will have to accept her destiny and fight like hell.

<p><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/episode-guide/season-02"><strong>About Season 2:</strong></a> To ensure that no one in Fairy Tale Land&mdash;especially <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/snow-white">Snow White</a>&mdash;had any more "happily ever afters," <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/evil-queen">Evil Queen Regina</a> cast a curse which trapped the fairy tale characters, frozen in time, and brought them into our modern world. Although still alive, they had no knowledge of their former selves and were sleepwalking through life&mdash;ageless&mdash;for 28 years, until a savior arrived in the form of <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/emma-swan">Emma Swan</a>. Unbeknownst to Emma, she was the daughter of Snow White and <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/prince-charming">Prince Charming</a>, who had whisked her out of Fairy Tale Land and into our world as an infant to save her from The Curse. Abandoned as a baby, Emma's life was anything but magical; her last job was as a bail bondsperson, but she mostly drifted without much of a life plan. When her 10-year-old son, <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/henry">Henry</a>&mdash;whom she had given up for adoption years earlier&mdash;appeared on her doorstep with a book of fairy tales and a wild story about how Emma was the progeny of fairy tale characters trapped in a town called Storybrooke, she thought he was crazy. But curiosity got the better of her, and when she brought Henry back to the town&mdash;where <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/evil-queen">Regina</a>, ever the control freak, had made herself mayor and was also Henry's adoptive mother&mdash;Emma soon discovered that Storybrooke was more than it seemed. Over time she came to believe the stories were true, began to see cracks in the curse, and was finally able to break it.</p>
<p>Reality and myth were merged as the fairy tale characters began awakening, once The Curse was lifted, and remembered who they were. But to their dismay they were not transported back to fairy tale land. And to make matters worse, <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/rumplestiltskin">Rumplestiltskin</a>&mdash;aka <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/rumplestiltskin">Mr. Gold</a>&mdash;in an effort to gain the upper hand in his power struggle with Regina, introduced magic into the town. In fairy tales magic has its place, but in our world it can have unfathomable consequences. Now the fairy tale characters must contend with magic in their quest to find a way home, as new fairy tale characters are revealed, old acquaintances are revisited, and some we had come to believe could be trusted will turn against their own kind.

<p><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/episode-guide/season-03"><strong>About Season 3:</strong></a> Welcome to Storybrooke, Maine, a small town that probably won't show up on your GPS, but it's a magical place to visit. Reality and myth merged after <a href="../../../../shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/emma-swan">Emma</a> broke <a href="../../../../shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/evil-queen">Regina's</a> curse, which had deprived the fairytale characters of their memories and trapped them in our modern world. When they finally regained their identities, our heroes were dismayed to discover that they weren't transported back to Fairy Tale Land. To make matters worse, <a href="../../../../shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/rumplestiltskin">Rumplestiltskin</a>&mdash;aka Mr. Gold&mdash;decided to escalate his power struggle with Regina by introducing magic into the town. But this is our world, and magic always has a tendency to yield unfathomable consequences.</p>
<p>The first order of business this season was to save <a href="../../../../shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/henry">Henry</a>, who had been kidnapped and transported through a portal to Neverland. But Neverland was a much darker place than one remembers, and our heroes had to face a foe more powerful than the Dark One himself&mdash;Peter Pan. After being tricked and led astray for days&mdash;and learning that he was also Rumplestiltskin's father&mdash;Pan was defeated and trapped inside Pandora's Box. Our heroes returned to Storybrooke, only to discover that Pan had switched bodies with Henry and was about to enact a curse that would have killed every living soul in town. But after discovering the switch and restoring Henry back into his body, Rumplestiltskin paid the ultimate price by sacrificing his life and killing Pan. In turn, Regina obliterated her original curse, which erased Storybrooke from existence and whisked its residents back to Fairy Tale Land, leaving Emma and Henry together back in our world with pleasant memories&mdash;but with no memories of Storybrooke or its residents, and with Storybrooke itself seemingly gone for good. And they all lived happily ever after... Hardly!</p>
<p>All is not well back in the Enchanted Forest when <a href="../../../../shows/once-upon-a-time/cast/captain-hook">Hook</a> comes calling on Emma in New York City in an attempt to jog her memory so that she can once again help her fairy tale family and friends out of a desperate situation. Everyone she holds dear is in danger as a new foe emerges&mdash;the Wicked Witch of the West. Hook now must enlist Emma in an epic struggle that spans worlds: with the highest stakes possible&mdash;the fate of her family. No one remembers how they were transported back or the past year they had spent back in Fairy Tale Land. But someone in town is responsible for this curse, and all clues point to the Wicked Witch of the West.</p>
<p>The Wicked Witch, aka Zelena, forced Rumplestiltskin to help her carry out her evil plan. The struggle between them leads to the death of Neal. A trip to Oz reveals that Zelena is Regina&rsquo;s half-sister. She plots to go back in time to kill Snow White&rsquo;s mother, whose actions sent her down a wicked path. An epic battle takes place. In the end, Rumplestiltskin kills the Wicked Witch while setting forth the opening of a time portal. Emma and Hook are pulled inside. They return to Storybrooke with a prisoner from a far off place. Regina is crushed to see that it&rsquo;s Marian, Robin Hood&rsquo;s first love. Someone else came forth from the time portal. Her name is Elsa. She demonstrates her power to freeze anything as she makes her way toward downtown Storybrooke.

<p><strong><a href="%20http:/abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time/episode-guide/season-04/">About Season 4:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>After defeating Zelena &mdash;&nbsp;the Wicked Witch of the West &mdash;&nbsp;Emma and Hook were pulled into her time portal, which brought them back to the Enchanted Forest of the past. When they accidentally thwarted the initial meeting of Snow White and Prince Charming, Emma and Hook had to find a way to fix the timeline and get them together, or risk altering their futures and possibly obliterating Emma and Henry's existence; not an easy task to undertake. When Emma was captured by The Evil Queen, she met a female prisoner scheduled to be executed. Upon finding a way to escape, Emma saved the prisoner's life by taking her along. But Hook believed the woman's fate was to die and feared that things could be altered by her continued existence. After successfully getting her parents back on track, Emma, Hook and the prisoner found themselves captured by Rumplestiltskin and imprisoned in a room that contained his most unpredictable magic. With no way to escape, Emma discovered that her own magic had returned, and she was able to whisk herself, Hook and the prisoner back to present day Storybrooke. Upon their joyous return, Emma learned that the prisoner was none other than Robin Hood's wife, Marian, who was presumed dead in the previous timeline. Regina and Robin Hood had begun to fall madly in love with one another, but with Marian's return, their relationship could be in danger. And, unbeknownst to anyone, Emma and Hook also brought back Elsa.</p>
<p>You never give up on the people you love...</p>
<p>The Storybrooke residents do not know what Elsa has in store for them. Back in the past, in Elsa's kingdom of Arendelle, we will discover what happened to her, her sister Anna and Kristoff, and how and why Elsa became a prisoner of Rumplestiltskin.</p>
<p>And now that Emma has brought back Robin Hood's wife, Marian, and possibly sparked the end of Regina's relationship with him, will she return to her old, evil ways and do everything in her power to get even? And newlyweds Belle and Rumplestiltskin continue to be deeply in love with each other. But Rumple is hiding a secret from Belle -- one that, if found out, could destroy their happiness - he continues to be the master of the dagger that calls upon him to be the Dark One. Can Emma and Hook commit to one another, and can these two damaged people take their love to the next level?</p>
<p>Mary Margaret and David have a new baby, Prince Neal, and are looking forward to raising him into a proud, brave and loving adult. But they are still sad that they were not able to do this with Emma, instead helping her escape the curse when she was first born and not meeting her again until she was 28 years old.</p>
<p>Henry is very happy to have both of his mothers back in Storybrooke. But with biological mom Emma and paternal grandfather Rumplestiltskin's blood running through his veins, he will be tested by both the light and the darkness.</p>
<p>Finally, Will Scarlet (Michael Socha, "Once Upon a Time in Wonderland"), a former member of Robin Hood's band of Merry Men, has traveled across many lands to make his way to Storybrooke. He finds himself intertwined in the goings-on in town for the first time as his mysterious past pushes him to an unknown future.</p>
<p>As the season continues, new fairy tale characters will be revealed and old acquaintances will be revisited. But not everyone can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>

The recipient of the 2015 and 2014 Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program, the business-themed show returns to the ABC Television Network for its seventh season.</p>
<p>The Sharks -- tough, self-made, multi-millionaire and billionaire tycoons -- continue their search to invest in the best businesses and products that America has to offer. The Sharks will once again give people from all walks of life the chance to chase the American dream, and potentially secure business deals that could make them millionaires.</p>
<p>The Sharks are: billionaire&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/mark-cuban"><strong>Mark Cuban</strong></a>, owner and chairman of AXS TV and outspoken owner of the 2011 NBA championship Dallas Mavericks; real estate mogul&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/barbara-corcoran"><strong>Barbara Corcoran</strong></a>; "Queen of QVC"&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/lori-greiner"><strong>Lori Greiner</strong></a>; technology innovator&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/robert-herjavec"><strong>Robert Herjavec</strong></a>; fashion and branding expert&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/daymond-john"><strong>Daymond John</strong></a>; and venture capitalist&nbsp;<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/bios/kevin-o-leary"><strong>Kevin O'Leary</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs who dare to enter the Tank must try to convince the Sharks to part with their own hard-earned cash and give them the funding they desperately need to turn their dreams into million dollar realities. All of the good, bad, emotional and even absurd pitches help showcase the "I wish&nbsp;<strong><em>I&nbsp;</em></strong>had thought of&nbsp;that" business ideas and products.</p>
<p>But the Sharks have a goal, too -- to get a return on their investment and own a piece of the next big business idea. When the Sharks hear an idea worth sinking their teeth into, they're more than ready to declare war and fight each other for a piece of it.</p>
<p>This season, Nick Woodman, one of America's newest and youngest billionaires and founder and CEO of GoPro, will be a guest Shark in multiple episodes. Forbes magazine calls GoPro a "cultural phenomenon" and "America's fastest-growing digital imaging company."</p>
<p>There will also be guest stars and specially-themed episodes, including ones featuring all-college students as well as all-veteran entrepreneurs. Episodes will continue to include follow-up stories, allowing viewers the opportunity to see how some investments led to success.</p>
<p>The hit unscripted series, which will reach its milestone 100th episode in November 2014, continues to be a ratings force, regularly finishing as Friday night's No. 1 series. Last season,&nbsp;<em>Shark Tank</em>&nbsp;dominated its 9 o'clock time period and surged by double digits year to year with Total Viewers (+16%) and Adults 18-49 (+14%), marking the series' best-ever season on both Nielsen measures.</p>
<p>In 2012 and 2013,&nbsp;<em>Shark Tank</em>&nbsp;received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Reality Program. Additional recognitions include two Summer Television Critics Association (TCA) nominations for Outstanding Achievement in Reality Programming (winning in 2013), three Critics Choice Award nominations for Best Reality Series (winning in 2014), and three Producers Guild Award nominations.</p>
<p>In Season 6, the Sharks are on track to surpass the amount of money offered each season in their investment deals. Over the past five seasons, the Sharks have offered more than&nbsp;<strong>$45 million</strong>&nbsp;to bankroll a creative array of innovative entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Viewers will continue to ride an emotional roller coaster this season, complete with heated fights between the Sharks,&nbsp;ingenious business ideas and touching moments. Whichever way the wheeling and dealing may go, many people's lives will be better off -- because they dared to enter the unpredictable waters of the Shark Tank.</p>
<p>Mark Burnett, Clay Newbill and Phil Gurin are the executive producers of&nbsp;<em>Shark Tank</em>, which is based on the Japanese&nbsp;<em>Dragons' Den</em>&nbsp;format created by Nippon Television Network Corporation. The series is produced by One Three Media in association with Sony Pictures Television.</p></span></section></div></article><article class="item"><div class="imageContainer"><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/this-week-with-george-stephanopoulos" title="This Week with George Stephanopoulos"><img class="replaceable" src="http://static.east.abc.go.com/service/image/index/id/be898432-e0b3-4f60-991e-7dbc73a88186/dim/16x9.png" alt="loading" data-properties='{"image":{"src":"8576e48f-f6b2-483a-9995-b9649f185857","alt":"This%20Week%20with%20George%20Stephanopoulos"}}' />This Week with George Stephanopoulos</a><section class="tuneInBar"><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/this-week-with-george-stephanopoulos" title="SUNDAY MORNINGS"><h2 class="tunein"><strong>SUNDAY</strong> MORNINGS</h2></a><span class="description hidden">n/a</span></section></div></article><article class="item fepAvailable"><div class="imageContainer"><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view" title="The View"><img class="replaceable" src="http://static.east.abc.go.com/service/image/index/id/be898432-e0b3-4f60-991e-7dbc73a88186/dim/16x9.png" alt="loading" data-properties='{"image":{"src":"48bac89b-95f4-43df-8995-12732b487d0a","alt":"The%20View"}}' />The View</a><section class="tuneInBar"><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view" title="WEEKDAYS 11e|10c|p"><h2 class="tunein"><strong>WEEKDAYS</strong> 11e|10c|p</h2></a><span class="description hidden"><p>&ldquo;The View&rdquo; is a live, one-hour daily talk show from ABC (11:00 a.m.-12:00 noon, ET) featuring moderator Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Candace Cameron Bure, Michelle Collins, Paula Faris and Raven-Symon&eacute;.

<p>Welcome to Los Angeles, circa 1982, during the rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, cocaine-infused revelry of the Sunset Strip. But all is not glitter as there&rsquo;s a serial killer on the loose, and two detectives find themselves on one of the toughest cases of their careers. &ldquo;Wicked City&rdquo; follows a unique case set in this noteworthy era of L.A. history, with the detectives determined to track down and bring the killer to justice before another murder can occur.</p>
<p>Many young women come to Hollywood with dreams of becoming a star. And the Sunset Strip was totally the happening place to be seen and make some connections. But you can&rsquo;t come to the City of Angels without bumping into some evil, which takes the form of Kent Grainger (Ed Westwick, &ldquo;Gossip Girl&rdquo;), a tragic soul who craves attention and goes on a murderous rampage to obtain notoriety.&nbsp; Kent is a chameleon who trolls the clubs to pick out his prey and pretends to be a Hollywood VIP who could help these hapless young ladies become stars.&nbsp; But if he finds one special enough to call in a personal song dedication to the local radio station, they are as good as dead.</p>
<p>Detectives Jack Roth (Jeremy Sisto, &ldquo;Six Feet Under,&rdquo; &ldquo;Suburgatory&rdquo;) and new partner Paco Contreras (Gabriel Luna, &ldquo;True Detective&rdquo;) are assigned to the case, and they will definitely have their work cut out for them. Jack has worked some high-profile cases in his time and has numerous contacts on the street.&nbsp; One such contact is Dianne Kubek (Karolina Wydra, &ldquo;True Blood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crazy, Stupid, Love&rdquo;), an undercover cop posing as a strip club cocktail waitress/drug dealer. Having an affair with each other also puts a strain on both their working and professional relationship. And Jack still holds a grudge against Paco, who narced on his ex-partner and got him kicked off the force.</p>
<p>Jack and Paco get a break when they stumble upon Karen McClaren (Taissa Farmiga, &ldquo;America Horror Story&rdquo;), a young, struggling journalist who is trying to write a big story on the Sunset Strip and make a name for herself. Unbeknownst to her at the time, she was approached by Kent in a club and gave him her phone number. She was also a witness to one of the ladies leaving a club who was later murdered. After getting a call from Kent to meet her again at the club, Jack and Paco convince her to be used as bait to try and catch the killer. But can they protect her against this monster?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kent has found himself a young woman who may be his &lsquo;Bonnie&rsquo; to his twisted &lsquo;Clyde&rsquo; in the form of Betty Beaumontaine (Erika Christensen, &ldquo;Parenthood&rdquo;), a nurse and single mother of two with a bit of a sadistic twist.&nbsp; He will find himself tempted to slowly pull her into his perverted world, perhaps joining him in his murderous rampage.</p>
<p>Alliances will be formed between detectives, reporters, drug dealers and club-goers to help solve this case and get this nut job off the street.&nbsp; But the clock is ticking as Kent continues to set his sights on the innocent, and Jack and Paco will go to any means necessary to hunt down and capture this scumbag &ndash; dead or alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked City&rdquo; stars Ed Westwick as Kent Grainger, Erika Christensen as Betty Beaumontaine, Jeremy Sisto as Jack Roth, Taissa Farmiga as Karen McClaren, Gabriel Luna as Paco Contreras, Karolina Wydra as Dianne Kubek, Evan Ross (&ldquo;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay,&rdquo; Parts 1 &amp; 2) as Diver Hawkes, Anne Winters (&ldquo;The Fosters&rdquo;) as Vicki Roth and Jaime Ray Newman (&ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&rdquo;) as Allison Roth.</p>

<p>The newest addition to the practice, Dr. Amelia Shepherd, is as gifted a surgeon as her Seattle-based brother, Derek, but is struggling to find herself as she learns to fit in with this close-knit group of surgeons. And Pacific Wellcare psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace is embittered after having pursued many of the women in the practice and come up empty-handed.</p>
<p>The doctors of Oceanside Wellness and Pacific Wellcare work on the most difficult cases, patients whose medical needs often pose moral and ethical dilemmas. Though they may heatedly disagree at work, and though their personal lives may complicate matters, at the end of the day they are the best of friends, always ready to be there for each other.</p>
