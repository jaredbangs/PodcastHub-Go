Adventure travel specialist Kurt Kutay (koo-TYE) fills us in on Peru's attractions, such as trekking to Machu Picchu in the Andes, and interacting with indigenous cultures and spotting wildlife in the Amazon. 
And, Rick calls travel writer David Stanley to learn how travelers can find a warm welcome in Fiji, and how it compares to its neighbors in the South Pacific.

Join us for adventures in the Southern Hemisphere to Peru and Fiji, on the next Travel with Rick Steves.

						<itunes:author>Rick Steves</itunes:author>
						<description><![CDATA[(note: June 25 is National Day in Slovenia; and it is also statehood day in Croatia - they each declared independence from Yugoslavia 15 years ago -- in 1991. ) 
        They're celebrating 15 years of independence in Slovenia and Croatia, and we're joining in the party on this week's Travel with Rick Steves. 
        Rick's tour guide friends from Slovenia join us in the studio to take listener calls and fill us in on why their small country has become the place to be for a no-pressure, bargain European escape - at least until they adopt the Euro and prices go up next year. 
      Join us as we get an insider's guide to Slovenia --  a pastoral land with storybook castles, turbo-folk music, and a collection of 'wild and crazy guys,' on the sunny side of the Alps.  And we'll also take a detour along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, on this week's Travel with Rick Steves.

          We'll get the latest on one of the world's hottest destinations --   Las Vegas, Nevada, where high stakes entertainment has replaced the ultra-cheap deals for which the Las Vegas Strip was famous.  Rick Garman has a new guidebook to the city, and tells us how to enjoy Vegas without "losing your shirt."
          Then, we'll cool off in the mountains with an overview of California's Yosemite    (yo-SEM-it-tee)   National Park with Ann Marie Brown, who knows it inside and out, and what it offers visitors year-round.

						<itunes:author>Rick Steves</itunes:author>
						<description><![CDATA[You probably already know that the flamenco, Sunday evening bullfights, tapas, and sangria are some of the flavors of Spain.   Now, as part of the European Union, Spain is a re-energized democracy that might also provide us examples for coping with the threats of terrorism. 
          Carlos Galvin  (gal-VEEN),  a travel specialist from Madrid, joins Rick this week to describe today's scene in his homeland, and to take listener calls about visiting Spain. 
          Also, we'll learn how the Spanish tradition of taking a midday nap -- the siesta -- has been helping Spaniards beat stress for centuries...and how its days may be numbered in modern, urban culture.   Julio Astor   (WHO-lee-oh   AS-tor)  of the Spanish Tourism Board joins Rick to explain the role of  "the siesta." 
          Discover the pleasures of Spain and its distinctive culture, on this week's Travel with Rick Steves. For more information on Travel with Rick Steves - including episode descriptions, program archives and related details - visit www.ricksteves.com.]]></description>

						<title><![CDATA[Armenia]]></title>
						<itunes:author>Rick Steves</itunes:author>
						<description><![CDATA[(note: Sept 21 is Armenian Independence Day) It's one of the newest nations in the world, and one of its oldest civilizations. And this week, Armenia is celebrating 15 years as an independent republic. We'll find out why it's a classic "back door" destination, on the next edition of Travel with Rick Steves. 

Rick's guest is Matthew Karanian (kah-RAIN-ee-ann), an American drawn to the land of his grandparents, who has co-authored a definitive guidebook to Armenia and the neighboring disputed land of Karabagh (CAR-ah-bock). 

We'll learn how Armenia provides a unique link to the ancient world, with some of the earliest Christian churches, a distinct language from its Indo-European neighbors, eco-tourism in its untouched countryside, and a society that has persisted for three thousand years, despite many adversaries. 

We're getting acquainted with Armenia...on the next Travel with Rick Steves. For more information on Travel with Rick Steves - including episode descriptions, program archives and related details - visit www.ricksteves.com.]]></description>
