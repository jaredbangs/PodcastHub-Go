      <itunes:summary>There's lots of discussion around assistive technology on the web, but what about technologies that aren't all about the browser? There are a number of conditions that have made it easier to develop assistive technology (social media, crowdfunding, rapid prototyping tools,etc.) Scott talks to Sylvia Richardson, an accessibility coordinator for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina about some of the many innovations in this space.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Creativity, Code, Community, and Connected Objects with Dawn C. Hayes</title>
      <link>http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?ShowID=16488</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
      <description>Scott talks with coder, tinkerer, and occasional adjunct professor Dawn C Hayes about the intersection of physical computing and creating coding. As we write code more, we have to ask ourselves "but are we improving our world? The community? Our culture?" The advent of wearables, augmented games, and networked objects has the potential to take computing out of the garage and into the collective consciousness. Dawn teaches Scott about how these objects can combine with new thinking around informal learning to engage not only new audiences but the next generation of creator.</description>

      <description>Scott talks to Developer and Designer Catt Small from SoundCloud. When you're a designer AND a front-end developer, where does one half of your personality end and the other half begin? Should prototypes be written in JavaScript and HTML or in a visual prototyping application?</description>
