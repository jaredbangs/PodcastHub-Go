				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Zook has a different perspective on life and business. He&#8217;s not afraid to try weird and crazy business ideas.</p>
<p>In 2008 he started a business called <a href="http://www.iwearyourshirt.com/">I Wear Your Shirt</a>. Over 5 years he earned over $1 million in revenue from wearing over 1,600 sponsored t-shirts. Following that business, he <a href="http://buymylastname.com/">sold the rights to his last name</a> (he was Jason Headsetsdotcom and Jason Surfrapp for awhile).</p>
<p>Jason joins me to talk about his new project: <a href="http://buymyfuture.com/?JustinJackson">Buy My Future</a>. Until October 6 people can buy everything he&#8217;s ever created, plus everything he&#8217;s going to create, for one price.</p>
<p>He explains the motivation behind the project, and how the launch is going so far (including revenue numbers).</p>
<p><span id="more-355"></span></p>
<h3>Notable quotes:</h3>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m asking people to buy into my life&#8217;s work, with access to everything I&#8217;ve ever created, and everything I will ever create.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A lot of people stifle their own creativity to fit in.</p></blockquote>

In 2008 he started a business called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwearyourshirt.com/&quot;&gt;I Wear Your Shirt&lt;/a&gt;. Over 5 years he earned over $1 million in revenue from wearing over 1,600 sponsored t-shirts.

<p><span id="more-351"></span></p>
<p>In this episode Tracy goes through the process of running a Kickstarter, and the <a href="https://hellowebapp.com/news/reviewing-hello-web-apps-kickstarter-campaign">lessons she&#8217;s learned</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I conceived the book idea, I was faced the decision whether I should work with a publisher, or whether I should self-publish. In the end, the typical royalty/advance structure turned me away from working with a publisher. Why not drum up an &#8220;advance&#8221; by running a Kickstarter campaign? If the campaign was successful, I would be able to bring in some early revenue to help finance my time with writing the book, as well as test demand and start building an audience. Seemed like a no-brainer.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>“I think not talking to your customers was always a pretty pathological thing to do” &#8211; Des Traynor</p>
<p><span id="more-336"></span></p>
<p>“Customer service is the new competitive edge. Everyone has SaaS businesses. We’re all using the same frameworks, copying the same design techniques. Most software being produced today is infinitely better than it was years ago. The competitive edge isn’t going to be who has the better bevel. I actually think it will move to things like: <em>&#8216;Who has a better relationship with the customer?&#8217;</em>” &#8211; Des Traynor</p>
<p>“There’s a ton of project management software. It’s hard to compete on features. But if you ask: ‘How do I make people really great at managing projects?’ The answers come to you a lot quicker.” &#8211; Des Traynor</p>
<p>“It’s the forgotten job of every single SaaS product. ‘Ok, you’ve sold me. Now help me sell it to the rest of the team.’ I can eat the $29, but getting me to spend my own social currency… that’s a big ask.” &#8211; Des Traynor</p>
<p>“The job of every dashboard and report is to get someone promoted” &#8211; Des Traynor</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell when someone has written something with no research; getting quality data, screenshots, and diagrams really helps.&#8221; &#8211; Sacha Greif</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a direct relationship between the amount of time I put into a blog post, and how popular it is&#8221; &#8211; Sacha Greif</p>
<p>&#8220;People respond to books: they don&#8217;t want to have to look through 20 blog posts.&#8221; &#8211; Sacha Greif</p>
<p>&#8220;I did something I shouldn&#8217;t have done &#8211; and I put all my eggs in one basket.&#8221; &#8211; Sacha Greif</p>
<p>&#8220;My first book is really short: it&#8217;s like 40 pages. I didn&#8217;t spend 6 months in a cave building it.&#8221; &#8211; Sacha Greif</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny: people think that when they&#8217;re done school, they&#8217;re done with homework. Do a bit of homework! You&#8217;ll stand out.&#8221; &#8211; Paul Jarvis</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t hire web designers because of skills. They want someone they trust.&#8221; &#8211; Paul Jarvis</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta go to them: you got to go where your audience lives and where your audience spends their time.&#8221; &#8211; Paul Jarvis</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about who you know, and whether those people trust you.&#8221; &#8211; Paul Jarvis</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week’s guest is <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/">Ryan Hoover</a>. We&#8217;ve been online friends for a few years now. Back in 2013, Ryan invited me to join a new site he&#8217;d created called <a href="http://ProductHunt.com">ProductHunt.com</a>. In the last 3 weeks, it&#8217;s exploded. He was interviewed on <a href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3668206308001/the-hunt-for-the-next-big-thing-in-tech/">Fox News</a>, he was interviewed on <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/product-hunt/">This Week in Startups</a>, AND he just announced that he’s joined YCombinator.</p>
<p class="p1">I actually recorded this episode on January 24, 2014 (5 months ago) &#8211; before Product Hunt got huge. I thought it would be interesting to revisit that conversation: to hear from the Ryan Hoover that hadn&#8217;t yet achieved all this recent success.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you hear it, you&#8217;ll understand why Ryan&#8217;s done so well: he built an audience (by blogging, and creating <a href="http://startupedition.com/">Startup Edition</a>), and then focused on creating something valuable for that community.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been entrepreneurial: as a child I created little joke books, and operated gum ball machines.&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Hoover</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what a Product Manager was 6 months before I became one.&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Hoover</p>
<p>&#8220;We built Product Hunt over 4 days, during Thanksgiving.&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Hoover</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspiration is perishable.&#8221; &#8211; Jason Fried</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to keep reminding myself that I can&#8217;t predict the future.&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Hoover</p>

We talked about finding an idea, validating an idea, and building your product. Our conversation started with this question: &#8220;What are the biggest misconceptions about running a SaaS product?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Notable quotes:</h3>
<p>&#8220;If you just want to create stuff, and write code, starting a business is not the best way to do that.&#8221; &#8211; Garrett Dimon</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely thought I was would be able to do more development and design; but it&#8217;s not really like that&#8221; &#8211; Garrett Dimon</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t describer their problems to us &#8211; they email us and tell us what they want us to build. That makes it difficult to see what their root problem is.&#8221; &#8211; Garrett Dimon</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t compete on features.&#8221; &#8211; Garrett Dimon</p>
<p>&#8220;No is easier to do. Yes is easier to say.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2642-no-is-easier-to-do-yes-is-easier-to-say">Jason Fried</a></p>

He&#8217;s build a SaaS, called <a href="http://planscope.io">Planscope</a>, but these days he recommends first-time entrepreneurs build something smaller (like an eBook, or a webinar).

<li>“Dentists are not typically googling around for dental software. To make the sale, you’ll need to knock on their door, and make a presentation. It’s not about the product, it’s about getting it in their hands.” &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
<li>“You want to tap into things that are actually affecting someone’s bottom line. Go back to the dentist example: is the dentist losing money with his crappy terminal based dental software? You have to tap into actual core needs.” &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so ages ago I interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/sfioritto">Sean Fioritto</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com">Sketching with CSS</a>. I like Sean a lot. He’s from Chicago, and he struggled for years trying to build products. Then he wrote this book, and it took off. You&#8217;ll hear his story, and how he succeeded after lots of failures.</p>
<p>I haven’t put out an episode in awhile. I have a bunch recorded but I haven’t had time to edit them and put them out. I’ve just been slammed: haven’t had time or energy for anything. It’s been pedal to the metal at work &#8211; we’re dealing with that Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation right now. Geez. And at home, there’s just always stuff to bring the kids to, appointments, classes, activities. So I’ve been drained!</p>
<p>Anyways. I’m hoping to put an end to this Product People drought, and start releasing episodes every Thursday now. So subscribe, and watch for new episode every Thursday.</p>
<p>On that topic. I’ve got a landing page up for something new: it’s called Product People Club. Go to <a href="http://productpeople.club">productpeople.club</a> on the internet, and sign up for the waiting list because I’ll have something to announce shortly.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of different failure modes, and I&#8217;ve pretty much done all of them.&#8221; &#8211; Sean Fioritto</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to give Amy Hoy and 30&#215;500 for giving me the right structure for building products. The main thing I figured out is you can&#8217;t start with an idea.&#8221; &#8211; Sean Fioritto</li>
<li>&#8220;Starting with an idea is a self-centered way to build a product.&#8221; &#8211; Sean Fioritto</li>
<li>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a bootstrapper, you don&#8217;t have time to waste.&#8221; &#8211; Sean Fioritto</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week you&#8217;ll hear from <a href="http://patio11.com">Patrick Mackenzie</a> (Patio11 on the internet), an influential member of the self-funded, bootstrapping community, as well as a high profile member of Hacker News. Patrick is a great guest: he&#8217;s a great storyteller, and is always completely himself. (He does some great voice impressions too)</p>
<p><strong>Our topic was: how to market yourself, make connections, and promote that app, SaaS, or other product you&#8217;ve just built.</strong></p>
<h3>Notable quotes:</h3>
<p>&#8220;I like to play League of Legends. The vast majority of people will never make a living off League of Legends. If you want to build your business on something like LoL, that&#8217;s probably not the best things.&#8221; &#8211; Patio11</p>
<p>&#8220;Self-promotion is not accepted by the community at every watering hole on the internet. Hacker News is a bit of an anomaly, because Hacker News is a community who are making or starting businesses.&#8221; &#8211; Patio11</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t submitted my stuff to Hacker News in years. I&#8217;m also really careful about what I publish. Before I publish a blog post, I ask: &#8216;Is this post worthy of being in the top 5 of Hacker News?'&#8221; &#8211; Patio11</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hacker News launch is like a mini version of the Techcrunch launch. But I wouldn&#8217;t bet the success of my business based on whether or not it gets to the top of Hacker News.&#8221; &#8211; Patio11</p>
<p>&#8220;My first internet business launched to a total of 76 people the first day. You can build your reputation organically, by building awesome things over time.&#8221; &#8211; Patio11</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week you&#039;ll hear from &lt;a href=&quot;http://patio11.com&quot;&gt;Patrick Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt; (Patio11 on the internet), an influential member of the self-funded, bootstrapping community, as well as a high profile member of Hacker News. Patrick is a great guest: he&#039;s a great storyteller, and is always completely himself. (He does some great voice impressions too)

Our topic was: how to market yourself, make connections, and promote that app, SaaS, or other product you&#039;ve just built.
Notable quotes:
&quot;I like to play League of Legends. The vast majority of people will never make a living off League of Legends. If you want to build your business on something like LoL, that&#039;s probably not the best things.&quot; - Patio11

&quot;Self-promotion is not accepted by the community at every watering hole on the internet. Hacker News is a bit of an anomaly, because Hacker News is a community who are making or starting businesses.&quot; - Patio11

&quot;I haven&#039;t submitted my stuff to Hacker News in years. I&#039;m also really careful about what I publish. Before I publish a blog post, I ask: &#039;Is this post worthy of being in the top 5 of Hacker News?&#039;&quot; - Patio11

&quot;The Hacker News launch is like a mini version of the Techcrunch launch. But I wouldn&#039;t bet the success of my business based on whether or not it gets to the top of Hacker News.&quot; - Patio11

&quot;My first internet business launched to a total of 76 people the first day. You can build your reputation organically, by building awesome things over time.&quot; - Patio11

This past week they decided to stop using the 37signals brand, and sell off (or stop developing) their other products (notably Highrise and Campfire).</p>
<p><strong>Our topic was: <em>Why is 37signals changing it&#8217;s name to Basecamp? How will this change the company? Was it worth building those other products?</em></strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Basecamp was special because it was forged out of constraints.&#8221; &#8211; DHH</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in trade-offs where it&#8217;s not easy: everyone wants more. More stuff, more money, more, more, more. What I find interesting is: &#8216;I want more peace of mind, and I&#8217;m going to give up some things for that.'&#8221; &#8211; DHH</p>

<p><strong>Our topic was: <em>finding an audience, discovering needs, and building products people want.</em></strong></p>
<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;The core problem with so many businesses is that they’re based on what the business owner wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They’re fantasizing about being the hero: “I’m going to ride in on my white ‘software’ horse, and save these poor people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as you can, you want to sell to people who will use your product. People who buy your product and don’t use it will never buy from you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Target people already in motion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling to wannabes has the least amount of upside; people who already have a business are more likely to spend money.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather have no money, than know that the vast majority of people that gave me the money aren&#8217;t achieving what they wanted to. If that&#8217;s true, I don&#8217;t want to be in that business.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wait a second, I thought this show was cancelled? <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Welcome to a brand new episode of Product People: this is the show that exposes you to the scrappy underworld of people creating their own products. No bullshit, no pretending: what does it take to build and launch your own thing?</p>
<p>This my conversation with Nathan Barry. It originally occurred on the community I run for bootstrappers called <a href="http://jfdi.bz">JFDI.BZ</a> (<em>Just Fucking Do It). </em>JFDI members were able to ask questions live, and have access to the full (video) interview. The podcast version is abridged, but has a lot of great stuff: specifically for building an email list.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Wait a second, I thought this show was cancelled? ;)

Welcome to a brand new episode of Product People: this is the show that exposes you to the scrappy underworld of people creating their own products. No bullshit, no pretending: what does it take to build and launch your own thing?

This my conversation with Nathan Barry. It originally occurred on the community I run for bootstrappers called &lt;a href=&quot;http://jfdi.bz&quot;&gt;JFDI.BZ&lt;/a&gt; (Just Fucking Do It). JFDI members were able to ask questions live, and have access to the full (video) interview. The podcast version is abridged, but has a lot of great stuff: specifically for building an email list.

If you&#039;d like to become a JFDI member, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jfdi.bz&quot;&gt;you can sign-up here&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;What stirred the discussion was that people were pissed off about the fat, big footer (where the email signup was).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People were asking: what&#8217;s this &#8216;good ui&#8217; guy doing with that big footer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at conversion optimization, the footer was a clear success. My conversion rate on that email sign-up is 20%. I have over 26,000 people on my list right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few factors that affected the success of sign-ups: the visibility of the call to action, plus a promise for future content, plus visuals that a depict a clear idea (they were sketched out on purpose), social proof, a small number of fields (just email), no commitment, the ability to unsubscribe at any time&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It costs me $200/month to send emails to this list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your landing page should be opinionated. This will fuel the debate and discussion. On Goodui.org I had this element of &#8216;this vs that&#8217;; I think stat stirs interest.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;In the early days, I spent from $6-$10 an hour on programmers from Odesk. Nowadays, when I hire developers I pay in the $20&#8217;s. It&#8217;s ways easier to find someone of better quality, when you pay them in the $20-$30 range. Now both of the developers I have are in Argentina.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The developers I&#8217;m hiring now, from Odesk, are better than the developers I worked with the USA that were making 6 figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I treat my full-time outsourced developers the same way I would treat a normal employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By outsourcing, I was able to build Buildsketch in 4 months. Quick.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m essentially a marketing guy, who&#8217;s trying to make something instead of just sell something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my Bachelor of Science in Religious Studies. It&#8217;s true. I have one of those.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I love Louis CK so much? He makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I working so hard? Why wouldn&#8217;t I just become a janitor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What could I do? I&#8217;m just a guy that could be a pretty decent blues band.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you worry about money now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have a successful business in 10 years, if you start right now. You can&#8217;t expect it to happen in 1 year; you should probably think about it happening over 4 years&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ichris">Chris Enns</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ttimsmith">Tim Smith</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/avclark">Adam Clark</a> have a great podcast called the <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/">Intellectual Radio Program</a>. I was recently listening to <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/8/">episode 8</a> on SSKTN.com. And right near the end, Chris has this beautifully honest moment, where he describes the frustration I think a lot of us feel when it comes to building our own products:</p>
<blockquote><p>How long do you hold on to something you&#8217;ve built?</p></blockquote>
<p>His co-host, Adam Clark pipes in, and brings up the topic we&#8217;re going to discuss today:</p>
<blockquote><p>It all depends on your goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goals. This is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about  recently. On Product People we focus a lot on tactics, and the processes people used to launch products (whether it&#8217;s a web app, an ebook, or downloadable software). But as I&#8217;ve reviewed a lot of these episodes, there&#8217;s this trend that keeps coming up: successful product people set goals.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I&#8217;m a little burnt out on goals. The other day I found a list of goals I&#8217;d written in a college. I think there were about 25 items on the list. Some goals I&#8217;d met, other goals I hadn&#8217;t; but that&#8217;s not the point. I think for a lot of us, setting goals reminds us of that 10 year year plan a lot of us wrote in school &#8211; it was kind of a bucket list.</p>
<p>But the goals that successful entrepreneurs set are different. And we&#8217;re going to discuss those in this episode with advice from people like Patio11, DHH, Spencer Fry, Dan Norris, and John Saddington.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our last episode we talked about how David started working as a contractor for 37signals making $15 an hour. He eventually worked his way up, and became an owner in the company (along with Jason Fried). In this episode we talk about he and Jason work together on a daily basis &#8211; and we go behind the scenes on their decision to rebuild Basecamp. We also talk about how he got into driving race cars (a mere 2 years after he got his license).</p>
<p>This is part 2 of the interview.</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re starting to build something new, it doesn&#8217;t really help to have a bunch of cooks in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What are you doing now?</em></p>
<p><em></em>&#8220;We have a new product idea in mind. I&#8217;m doing the same thing I did on BCX; just me and a designer, just spiking things out. If we decide to go ahead and build it, we&#8217;ll involve more people.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Do you just like building new stuff?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not just about greenfield development. I get a lot of pleasure about building things to last &#8211; I&#8217;m still working on Ruby on Rails a decade after I made the first changes. That&#8217;s still really satisfying to me. To me it&#8217;s just programming that&#8217;s fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Driving race cars is a dangerous amount of fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I discovered Ruby, I wanted to spread the wealth &#8211; to share it with as many programmers as I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is really interesting  to me (about programming) is getting <em>in the zone</em>; where you lose track of time, and other concerns. That&#8217;s a rare state of mind to be in.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>In our last episode we talked about how David started working as a contractor for 37signals making $15 an hour. He eventually worked his way up, and became an owner in the company (along with Jason Fried). In this episode we talk about he and Jason work together on a daily basis - and we go behind the scenes on their decision to rebuild Basecamp. We also talk about how he got into driving race cars (a mere 2 years after he got his license).

This is part 2 of the interview.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Heinemeier Hansson started working with Jason Fried as a contract worker from Denmark. How did he eventually become a partner at 37signals?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve kept in touch with David over the years, and we&#8217;d planned on doing an interview for awhile now. It finally happened this past week. This is a pretty personal interview. I spoke with David about growing up in Copenhagen, and how he met Jason (there&#8217;s a great story in there). We also discussed his new book (with Jason Fried) called <a href="http://37signals.com/remote">Remote</a>, and how he stays motivated when writing. This is part 1 of the interview.</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p><em>Can anyone at 37signals take advantage of moving to warmer climates? </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;Absolutely: I think about 1/4 of our people are in Chicago. We have quite a few people have moved around a lot. I think <a href="https://twitter.com/bitsweat">Jeremy Kemper</a>, who&#8217;s on the Rails core team, has moved about 4 or 5 times; mostly to warmer places on the West Coast. One of our support people, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3590-becoming-remote">Kristin, just moved from Chicago to Portland</a>. So, we definitely have people who take advantage of wherever they want to live. This is one of the great benefits of remote working &#8211; you can choose to live exactly where you want to, and it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I don&#8217;t drop a beat: it doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;m in Spain or Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, personally, it&#8217;s great to not be in the same city as everyone else. I do my best work in solitude. I love those short bursts of bandwidth with in-person collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People overemphasize the benefits of collaboration. Collaboration is great; but it&#8217;s overused in terms as a tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, the most important part of writing is having something to say.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your strategy for writing?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working on this book for the past 10 years (in terms of my forming the ideas, and gather the experiences). When it came to recording it all, the best strategy for me was to put on the turbo chargers and get it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[Growing up] I always loved good writing. That was my inspiration for starting my own magazine in high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That happens a lot: I get inspired by something, or someone, and say &#8211; &#8216;Hey, I want to do that to.'&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p><em>Is the market for self-published books getting saturated right now?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justin</strong>: &#8220;In our space (tech, design, dev, bootstrapping) it used to be there were only a few people doing it (Amy Hoy, Chris Guillebeau). Next, there was grassroots people who followed their lead, and came on the scene: Nathan Barry, Sacha Greif, Paul Jarvis. But now it seems like there are a lot of more established people getting in to publishing: <a href="http://brandiing.publicbeta.co/">Adii Pienaar</a>, <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/">Shawn Blanc</a>, <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2013/06/12/breakingthetimebarrier/">Mike McDerment</a> (Freshbooks). Do you think there&#8217;s too many players in this space now?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Sacha</strong>: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. I think maybe it seems that way to us because we&#8217;re so involved in this space. Although it&#8217;s true that there are a lot of books coming out now for people like us: books about design, and books about self-publishing; that niche might get saturated soon. But the vast majority of ebooks are about other things: CSS, food&#8230; that will never get saturated.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Nathan</strong>: &#8220;I think there will always be demand to pay $50 or less for high quality content that&#8217;s really specific to a topic you care about (as a reader). Instead of going through 50 blog posts on the internet, you spend a little bit of money to get the best stuff on that topic in a PDF. I don&#8217;t think it will become too saturated. We also tend to run in really specific circles on the internet and so when we see something we think: wow the whole internet is talking about this, when in reality it&#8217;s just your tiny little corner, and 12 people.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Justin</strong>: &#8220;The hard thing is&#8230; if you&#8217;re already &#8216;in&#8217; and you already have an audience, it&#8217;s easier to say that it&#8217;s not saturated. Certain niches can definitely get saturated. <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-135-may-listener-questions">Rob Walling just commented on his podcast</a> that there&#8217;s been a big, noticeable increase in the number of people asking him (and other founders) to do interviews for books. If it&#8217;s true, that there is more saturation, it means that everybody&#8217;s quality and uniqueness will have to go up &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to offer something that no one else is doing.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/brennandunn">Brennan Dunn</a> (from the chat room): &#8220;Rob was mainly arguing against ebook &#8220;authors&#8221; who just publish a bunch of other people&#8217;s writing. e.g. email a bunch of people, compile them into book, profit.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Amy Hoy</a> (from the chat room): &#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a definitely a saturation level with &#8216;I&#8217;m not gonna do any work on this product but you should still pay me&#8217; LOL&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mhartl">Michael Hartl</a> (from the chat room): &#8220;This is still early, early days for ebook publishing.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/JoelleSteiniger">Joelle Steiniger</a> (from the chat room): &#8220;Everyone always thinks there&#8217;s no room left&#8230; and there always is.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Sacha</strong>: &#8220;I think the key point is quality. For example: interviews are really interesting, but there also really easy to do; that&#8217;s why there are a lot of e-books that are just a collection of interviews. Unless you&#8217;re a professional interviewer, your questions might not always be interesting. So that niche might produce a lot of low quality ebooks. But if that gets saturated, who cares? It will only push people to make higher quality books.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Justin</strong>: &#8220;Yeah. And maybe that&#8217;s something else we have to be prepared for: the professional ebook critic. Right now it&#8217;s a fairly friendly space.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Paul</strong>: &#8220;You should read some of my comments on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads</a>: there are some reviewers that don&#8217;t like stuff that are vocal.&#8221;</li>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>Nathan: &#8220;If you try to wait until you&#8217;re a great writer, that&#8217;s bad. I had someone contact me who read every one of my blog posts. He said in his email: &#8216;Man, when you started you were a horrible writer. But I could see you getting better each post you wrote.&#8217; I would say: start writing, and use that to get better at writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul: &#8220;I feel the same way. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a great writer, but I know that I&#8217;m a lot better now than when I started writing. The only way I got better, was by writing. I write every day; I don&#8217;t publish work every day (that&#8217;s not the point). The more that I sit down and write, the more ideas that I come up with that are worth publishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sacha: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a fixed amount of words to write every day. I approach writing like design: start with a sketch, low fidelity mockup, high fidelity&#8230; every iteration comes close and closer to the real thing. I start with outline of the chapters, and start filling them up. For <a href="http://www.discovermeteor.com/">Discover Meteor</a>, we must have gone through each chapter about 10 times, it was really iterative.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;LessConf was a fun little hobby that started to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With our app, we&#8217;re still battling it out for users, and LessConf was becoming a distraction&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Notoriety in the startup community doesn&#8217;t translate into users in the small business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Notoriety and fame and all that bullshit feels good; it&#8217;s a disease. It sucks you in… looking at Instagram likes, and who likes stuff, and re-tweets you. If startups aren&#8217;t your target marketing, notoriety can be a distraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Running a conference is like being a bride at a wedding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about a social network to connect golfing buddies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We both took pay cuts to start LessEverything, because we wanted to build a nest-egg to build products&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a partner makes it better. Steve likes to make my ideas better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good partner will give you the courage to be more of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ignorant user is your best customer.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;Uncover gives employers the ability to give perks and rewards to their employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies are too quick to iterate. You have to look at the broader picture. You have to set aside time for bigger wins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take time away from the everyday grind, to try something big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you know when you should throw in the towel? That&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t like doing. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I choose to bootstrap. If your raise money you have to throw in the towel a lot sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One criticism of the HR space is that it&#8217;s difficult to sell products to that niche.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Small companies get their best applicants through referrals and employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Longterm, what we want to do is educate companies around employee happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sales or die. Sales is important: the internet is saturated with startups. You have to go after customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You live and die on your potential customer list.&#8221;</p>

&quot;Small companies get their best applicants through referrals and employees.&quot;

&quot;Longterm, what we want to do is educate companies around employee happiness.&quot;

&quot;Sales or die. Sales is important: the internet is saturated with startups. You have to go after customers.&quot;

&quot;You live and die on your potential customer list.&quot;

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;When I was 10 years old, I had really, really high speed internet. All my friends were on dial-up, but I was on Yale&#8217;s high speed connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I started with being really interested in video games, which eventually lead to TypeFrag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you figure out quality voice-over-IP when you were 19?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For TypeFrag, most of our sales growth came from podcast sponsorship, and video game team sponsorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;90% of a business&#8217; success is marketing and sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spend 90% of your time thinking about how you&#8217;re going to get users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like people are way too focused on product development and design, and not focused enough on the sales and the marketing. Especially new entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time you talk I&#8217;m thinking: these are crazy lessons for someone so young to be learning.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;I realized with my first business, that I&#8217;d built something that didn&#8217;t scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I also realized, that I don&#8217;t want to do sales. I don&#8217;t get energy from going out and doing sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder calls himself the Claff, which kind of sounds like an STD.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a second; are you allowed to swear on your show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about putting a price on something, and seeing if people will pay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s running a software business, who&#8217;s started in the last couple of years, who are making a lot of money. I didn&#8217;t realize that at first. It takes a long time to build up the product, to where it&#8217;s good enough. SaaS takes a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mailing list is a massive leg up. When I do something now, people find out about it, which is half the battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Authority is a hugely valuable asset. Do whatever you do best, that will get people the most amount of relevant people aware of what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People won&#8217;t tell you what they want. I&#8217;ve asked people &#8216;would you pay for this?'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I started learning web development the day I started by web development business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The customer said &#8216;we want a CMS&#8217;. I said &#8216;Sure, I can do that&#8217;, so I went home and googled CMS.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t build any app on-top of WordPress. It works really well for apps that are content based.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Customizing the existing wp-admin is a lot of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For an MVP, WordPress would work fine. But for something bigger that you want scale, it&#8217;s probably better to use something (like Ruby on Rails).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that WordPress has custom post types, there&#8217;s way more you can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter anymore what technology you&#8217;re using on the backend. The bar&#8217;s really been raised in terms of what users expect [in the front-end experience].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to be content when app just did something, Hotmail did email. But now we have higher expectations on how an app [looks and feels].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to understand the users mores, as opposed to what code powers the back-end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched Happy Tables in February, 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our traffic is organic traffic.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;Raise a little of angel funding, prove that there&#8217;s product market, and then go out and get second market funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Uber doesn&#8217;t go into every market, someone else will, but they still have other people popping up in new markets before they get there. So they&#8217;re in a race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raise less money in the beginning, raise more money once you have product market fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>JJ: &#8220;There are some great products that have grown really fast, and have stayed private and bootstrapped (MailChimp, SurveyMonkey, Valve). Do you think they&#8217;re anomalies?&#8221;<br />
JC: &#8220;There are some people that stay private, and that&#8217;s good because they retain their equity. There&#8217;s not one way to do this. But some of those companies are 10 year &#8216;over night&#8217; successes.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most businesses don&#8217;t need venture funding. The truth is, there&#8217;s a time for both [bootstrapping and taking venture money].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors need liquidity. There&#8217;s a secondary market for shares today. This really didn&#8217;t exist that much before. You used to be forced into an IPO. There&#8217;s a concept that (perhaps) venture capitalists would start taking dividends; but it&#8217;s more likely that they&#8217;ll just sell their shares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to building for the sale is a terrible idea. You want to build for a growing market, a customer that loves you, and a team that loves to build the product. When I was hiring for Inside.com, I realized there&#8217;s a lot of developers into our space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Building to sell is a dangerous idea. When people come to me for an angel investment and say &#8216;This is a natural acquisition target&#8217;, I say &#8216;That&#8217;s not what you lead with.&#8217; That&#8217;s not why you build it, you build it because you have a better solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re thinking about these big acquisitions, I encourage people to just drop off 3 zeroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out, there&#8217;s a lot of money in the world. The money is bored. Money wants to be spent! Money is intended to be gambled. These are big numbers, but these are big companies.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally we cover bootstrapped products: people who are self-funding the stuff they build. We do this because I&#8217;m naturally drawn to bootstrapped companies.</p>
<p>For this episode I wanted to go into &#8220;enemy&#8221; territory: I wanted to talk to the VC community. To do that I contacted Jason Calacanis, an angel investor, and the voice of funded startups on his podcast This Week In Startups. This is part 1 where we delved into the human said of Mr. Calacanis &#8211; where he came from, and how he got to where he is today.</p>
<h3>Sponsors</h3>

<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;My first business was making copies of Star Wars on BetaMax for my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think being an entrepreneur is the best mode of existence; but I do think it&#8217;s important for our kids to see us working hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me a great entrepreneur, I&#8217;ll show you a fucked up relationship with their parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were these things called BBSes. I had a 300 BAUD modem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In college I was making $3.50/hour managing computer systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my first jobs was doing LotusNotes scripting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw Mosaic, the first browser, I was like: Whoa. When they added images, the internet felt like a magazine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People thought that paying bloggers was sacrilegious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought doing 10 blog posts a day on gadgets was crazy. But we ultimately we ended up doing 40, 50, 60 posts a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weblogs Inc. was a great product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We sold the first podcast ad ever to Volvo. We commercialized it; we saw there was a business opportunity there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When people use it, and can&#8217;t shut up about it, you know you&#8217;ve got a great product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to tinker, I like to build products. I&#8217;ve had a lot of opportunities to do other stuff, but I like product.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Martell discovered computers in rehab. After he overcame his problems with drugs, he taught himself to program. From there, he started building businesses. Eventually, he travelled to San Francisco to learn everything he could from the startup scene.</p>
<p>You might recognize his former product: Flowtown, and his current one: Clarity. In this episode Dan shares his story from the beginning, and how he overcame a difficult beginning to build his own products.</p>
<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;I got the idea for Clarity because I had people emailing asking me to take me to coffee, needing help. I wanted to help them, but I couldn&#8217;t help them. I wished there was a way to get their information, and call them back when I was free. I built it on <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, which would proxy my number (so no one found my cell number)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It took me 2 days to build that first prototype that worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tweeted out: &#8216;If you need advice on your startup, give me a call'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like: this is what the internet is supposed to do!&#8221;</p>
<p>How did you know people would pay for it? &#8220;Once it was out there, I was getting too many calls. So I put up a paywall. It was crazy; people started paying [big numbers].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The world rewards courageous decisions; I honestly believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does a hit look like? Retention. When someone uses it, and keeps using it. Even better: if they also tell other people to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always this confusion as to what would people would pay for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to admit I was building a two-sided marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need engineers to be more productive, I just need to stop asking them to build stupid stuff that nobody needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody, listening to this podcast does more customer development than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the key to a good customer development interview? DON&#8217;T SELL.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting someone to pay is true customer validation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;ve created and keep a customer, you&#8217;ve got a real business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to index people&#8217;s brains, like Google indexes text.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People are listening to this podcast because conversations carry a lot more context.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find 10 people that will pay you money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is not <em>can you build it</em> it&#8217;s <em>should you build it</em><em>?&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Martell discovered computers in rehab. After he overcame his problems with drugs, he taught himself to program. From there, he started building businesses. Eventually, he travelled to San Francisco to learn everything he could from the startup scene.</p>
<p>You might recognize his former product: Flowtown, and his current one: Clarity. In this episode Dan shares his story from the beginning, and how he overcame a difficult beginning to build his own products.</p>
<h3>Notable quotes</h3>
<p>&#8220;I had a hard upbringing, my mother was an alcoholic. I was removed from my home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Built tree forts, when I was 8 or 9, and I would charge the other kids to come play in them&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been into building and selling stuff&#8230; so I took to selling drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in rehab that I discovered computers. I learned to build stuff that wasn&#8217;t illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the stuff you learn selling drugs, translates to business acumen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clarity&#8217;s foundation is getting advice from people that have been there before. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should only get advice from people that have been there before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle was selling roller blades in his basement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as possible, your company needs to make money. If you can get anyone to show up and pay you $1, you&#8217;ve made it on the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t [charge money for their products], because they&#8217;re scared that their product sucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It took me a few failed attempts before I made my first million.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was 21, I was hired to work for an oil company in the tar sands. My job title was Solutions Architect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost went bankrupt in 6 weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I became a millionaire when I was 27.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get 3-4 venture cap firms cold emailing me every week.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>Dan Martell discovered computers in rehab. After he overcame his problems with drugs, he taught himself to program. From there, he started building businesses. Eventually, he travelled to San Francisco to learn everything he could from the startup scene.

You might recognize his former product: Flowtown, and his current one: Clarity. In this episode Dan shares his story from the beginning, and how he overcame a difficult beginning to build his own products.
Notable quotes
&quot;I had a hard upbringing, my mother was an alcoholic. I was removed from my home.&quot;

&quot;Built tree forts, when I was 8 or 9, and I would charge the other kids to come play in them&quot;

&quot;I&#039;ve always been into building and selling stuff... so I took to selling drugs.&quot;

&quot;It was in rehab that I discovered computers. I learned to build stuff that wasn&#039;t illegal.&quot;

&quot;A lot of the stuff you learn selling drugs, translates to business acumen.&quot;

&quot;Clarity&#039;s foundation is getting advice from people that have been there before. &quot;

&quot;You should only get advice from people that have been there before.&quot;

&quot;My uncle was selling roller blades in his basement.&quot;

&quot;As soon as possible, your company needs to make money. If you can get anyone to show up and pay you $1, you&#039;ve made it on the internet.&quot;

&quot;People don&#039;t [charge money for their products], because they&#039;re scared that their product sucks.&quot;

&quot;It took me a few failed attempts before I made my first million.&quot;

&quot;When I was 21, I was hired to work for an oil company in the tar sands. My job title was Solutions Architect.&quot;

&quot;I almost went bankrupt in 6 weeks.&quot;

&quot;I became a millionaire when I was 27.&quot;

&quot;I get 3-4 venture cap firms cold emailing me every week.&quot;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, let me ask you a question: when you were a kid, after a game of Mario Brothers, did you ever take out a pencil and paper and try to draw your own video game levels? The idea of creating video games from a kid&#8217;s imagination is something that today&#8217;s guest is working on.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;Growing up, playing Mario Bros and Donkey Kong, I would draw my own video game levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of us that grew up in the 80&#8217;s, we&#8217;re in our 30&#8217;s, we grew up dreaming of creation our own video games.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes the press can pick up on an idea that isn&#8217;t really viable as business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing other games that have been successful in this niche, like Minecraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monetizing through education markets is really challenging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Kickstarter campaign is really time consuming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t you get Angel funding? &#8220;If one person gives you $100,000 it doesn&#8217;t really validate your product idea. Having 1,000 paying customers validates your idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does Kickstarter give you the contact information for backers? &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s an export button: but you have to be backed, or your campaign has to be over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t always take a big budget to test out your idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that conversation with your wife like?&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:subtitle>Hey, let me ask you a question: when you were a kid, after a game of Mario Brothers, did you ever take out a pencil and paper and try to draw your own video game levels?

		<itunes:summary>Hey, let me ask you a question: when you were a kid, after a game of Mario Brothers, did you ever take out a pencil and paper and try to draw your own video game levels? The idea of creating video games from a kid&#039;s imagination is something that today&#039;s guest is working on.
Highlights
&quot;Growing up, playing Mario Bros and Donkey Kong, I would draw my own video game levels.&quot;

&quot;A lot of us that grew up in the 80&#039;s, we&#039;re in our 30&#039;s, we grew up dreaming of creation our own video games.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes the press can pick up on an idea that isn&#039;t really viable as business.&quot;

&quot;We&#039;re seeing other games that have been successful in this niche, like Minecraft.&quot;

&quot;Monetizing through education markets is really challenging.&quot;

&quot;A Kickstarter campaign is really time consuming.&quot;

Why didn&#039;t you get Angel funding? &quot;If one person gives you $100,000 it doesn&#039;t really validate your product idea. Having 1,000 paying customers validates your idea.&quot;

Does Kickstarter give you the contact information for backers? &quot;Yes, there&#039;s an export button: but you have to be backed, or your campaign has to be over.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#039;t always take a big budget to test out your idea.&quot;

&quot;What was that conversation with your wife like?&quot;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Product People: does Amy Hoy still get scared before a launch? How do you choose an audience? And she answers some listener questions.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;The 30&#215;500 bootcamp has been moved to June 15/16: <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first"><em>Why you should do a tiny product first</em></a>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much of what we&#8217;re doing (with our online courses) is creating community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Bacon Biz community will be open to everybody: baconbiz.com&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have set-up their lives where they let themselves get jerked around by their emotions all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you launch something, you&#8217;re going to get good feedback and bad feedback. No matter what the price is, somebody&#8217;s going to complain about the price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People unconsciously prioritize their feelings as an excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you&#8217;ll go to someone, because you need some advice, but they&#8217;ll end up re-enforcing the wrong things. You need to find people that can focus on facts.&#8221; &#8211; Justin</p>
<p>&#8220;So many ills are cause by just reacting to feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What really scares me is karaoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask yourself: What logical data is telling me I should be afraid? What&#8217;s the worst possible thing that could happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key, seems to be, to keep trying things. Not everything&#8217;s a home run, but they keep trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people&#8217;s fear is of what people will think of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The easiest way for me to turn this around, is to quit being so self-centred. To keep reminding myself: it&#8217;s not about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask: what do I want to build? Ask: what do people need?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t actually help anyone; you can only help people that want to help themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to help people with something specific, as opposed to being general. You&#8217;ll</p>
<p>&#8220;When people ask me: &#8216;what audience should I serve?&#8217; I ask them: &#8216;Well, what are you? If you&#8217;re a Ruby developer, than serve Ruby developers!&#8217; Stick within your own circles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already chosen your audience by who you&#8217;re already associating with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To punch above your weight you need to use every single advantage you have. If you try to pick a new market you know nothing about, you&#8217;re giving up one of your core advantages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Start serving the audience you already belong to.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can people break out of their insecurity? &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of &#8216;who you are&#8217;. Do your research: what does it tell you? You don&#8217;t have to wonder &#8216;what do I have to offer that people want?&#8217; Look at your resume.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always be researching customers; never stop. I look wherever people congregate: forums, mailing lists, blog posts, off-hand comments from people on Twitter, support portals, user groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t walk up and ask people what their problems are; you have to observe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where do you keep your customer research notes? &#8220;I use a text file. Simple as that. Don&#8217;t use fancy tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For content marketing, I take what I&#8217;ve learned in my research phase, and write posts around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we sell people things, are we pandering to their narcism? &#8220;It&#8217;s not narcissistic to think about yourself, and what you need. It&#8217;s narcissistic to think that everything&#8217;s about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to add new features to compete. New features don&#8217;t always make a product better.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Hoy gives a personal interview on her growing up in suburban Maryland, programming on an Apple Iic, selling her My Little Ponies to buy a Power Mac, and how she ended up building her first products.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;I started programming when I was 7 year old. At home we had an Apple IIc, and I wrote some programs in BASIC on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Programming books suck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up in suburban Maryland. It was a wasteland: the only place to get coffee was at a gas station, or one of those sub shops that don&#8217;t have a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up, I didn&#8217;t have any business mentors. I was all alone. I learned from books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was always hustling trying to get money. To buy my Power Mac I sold all of my My Little Ponies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My entire life, everyone told me I couldn&#8217;t do stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dropped out of high school in 9th grade and started freelancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Communicating and teaching are my #1 passions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me it&#8217;s really interesting how people hear about people, and start following people&#8221; &#8211; Justin</p>
<p>&#8220;Twistori ended up making us a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Working for this startup was like living in Dilbert, but with lots more money and parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It took about 1-2 days a week, for 3 months to build Freckle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember hearing about the 30&#215;500 formula, and thinking: &#8216;Whoa! That&#8217;s doable'&#8221; &#8211; Justin</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a 30&#215;500 bootcamp on June 9-10. The cost will be $1,550.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>Amy Hoy gives a personal interview on her growing up in suburban Maryland, programming on an Apple Iic, selling her My Little Ponies to buy a Power Mac, and how she ended up building her first products.
Highlights
&quot;I started programming when I was 7 year old. At home we had an Apple IIc, and I wrote some programs in BASIC on that.&quot;

&quot;Programming books suck.&quot;

&quot;I grew up in suburban Maryland. It was a wasteland: the only place to get coffee was at a gas station, or one of those sub shops that don&#039;t have a name.&quot;

&quot;Growing up, I didn&#039;t have any business mentors. I was all alone. I learned from books.&quot;

&quot;I was always hustling trying to get money. To buy my Power Mac I sold all of my My Little Ponies.&quot;

&quot;My entire life, everyone told me I couldn&#039;t do stuff.&quot;

&quot;I dropped out of high school in 9th grade and started freelancing.&quot;

&quot;Communicating and teaching are my #1 passions.&quot;

&quot;To me it&#039;s really interesting how people hear about people, and start following people&quot; - Justin

&quot;Twistori ended up making us a lot of money.&quot;

&quot;Working for this startup was like living in Dilbert, but with lots more money and parties.&quot;

&quot;It took about 1-2 days a week, for 3 months to build Freckle.&quot;

&quot;I remember hearing about the 30x500 formula, and thinking: &#039;Whoa! That&#039;s doable&#039;&quot; - Justin

&quot;We&#039;re doing a 30x500 bootcamp on June 9-10. The cost will be $1,550.&quot;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Product People! What&#8217;s your process for finding an idea that people love? How do you take your initial hunch for an idea, and make it a reality? What is a funnel? Hiten Shah from Kissmetrics is back to answer these questions and more!</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;Making human connections is the most important thing in any startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need some sound reasoning behind why you&#8217;re building your product. It&#8217;s a balance of having a vision AND taking all the customer inputs you can find to make sure that your vision can be a reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Study great product people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to have an unbiased curiosity; like a method actor. You take off your shoes, and go find that other person&#8217;s shoes and start walking in them. You start walking, acting and observing like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get unbiased facts about your customers. Know them better than they know themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We discovered that building a funnel in Google Analytics is painful. And so we started thinking: how can we take the pain out of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best things about going to industry conferences is learning about your potential customers. It&#8217;s full on anthropology!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The creation of the product is a big social experiment. As you understand people, you can ask: how can I save them time, make money or save money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any step by step process that exists in life, has drop-off. And to me, what a funnel allows you to do is figure out that drop-off. It helps you identify where your problems are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key things we&#8217;re learning is that you need to build an audience before you build your product. Build your audience not for marketing, but for learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our listeners tell us that building and audience is way scarier than building a product.&#8221; &#8211; Justin Jackson</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask these questions: 1) Who is it I&#8217;m trying to reach? 2) Where do they hang out? 3) How can I reach them there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s world you should be able to get people paying right away. If you&#8217;ve spent a year, and you don&#8217;t have anyone willing to pay you, it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll never pay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An idea is a solution to a problem. What problem does that idea solve? My suggestion to people is asking: how do you know that a lot of other people have this problem?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you build a healthy software business when you don&#8217;t know how to code? Hiten Shah is on the show today. He and his co-founder Neil Patel, have built two successful SaaS apps: CrazyEgg, and Kissmetrics.</p>
<p>Today you&#8217;ll hear Hiten&#8217;s secret to being a successful entrepreneur.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to &#8216;feel&#8217; like an entrepreneur. To me entrepreneurship isn&#8217;t a feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you create something, out of nothing, and somebody consumes it and loves it &#8211; that&#8217;s entrepreneurship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The people that get stuck… they don&#8217;t bother to figure out what it is (that they can make) that people will love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be an entrepreneur you have to build things, and people have to love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost any problem you see in a company boils down to people and product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to manufacture genuine customer appreciation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the creators of things, the people part is huge. You need to ask: &#8216;how do you humanize a product&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;CrazyEgg was 1 of 10 things we tried; and it was the one that resonated the most with people.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>Can you build a healthy software business when you don&#039;t know how to code? Hiten Shah is on the show today. He and his co-founder Neil Patel, have built two successful SaaS apps: CrazyEgg, and Kissmetrics.

Today you&#039;ll hear Hiten&#039;s secret to being a successful entrepreneur.
Highlights
&quot;I don&#039;t know how to &#039;feel&#039; like an entrepreneur. To me entrepreneurship isn&#039;t a feeling.&quot;

&quot;When you create something, out of nothing, and somebody consumes it and loves it - that&#039;s entrepreneurship.&quot;

&quot;The people that get stuck… they don&#039;t bother to figure out what it is (that they can make) that people will love.&quot;

&quot;To be an entrepreneur you have to build things, and people have to love them.&quot;

&quot;Almost any problem you see in a company boils down to people and product.&quot;

&quot;It&#039;s hard to manufacture genuine customer appreciation.&quot;

&quot;As the creators of things, the people part is huge. You need to ask: &#039;how do you humanize a product&#039;?&quot;

&quot;CrazyEgg was 1 of 10 things we tried; and it was the one that resonated the most with people.&quot;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the show today is one of the best bootstrappers in the business: <a href="http://twitter.com/salted">Paul Farnell</a> of <a href="http://www.litmus.com/?utm_source=productpeople&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=ep22">Litmus.com</a> joins me and shares some great stories.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;It felt magical to send an email to a random address, and then showing screenshots of the HTML email design. It was a magical thing when we got it working.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a technical challenge in automating Lotus Notes 7 on an old version of Windows, and then delivering that result to a beautiful Rails app&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of business opportunities in that stuff that people just grind through on a daily basis. Think <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://litmus.com">Litmus</a>, etc…&#8221; &#8211; Justin Jackson</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at our curve of revenue, it starts very slowly for the first 2.5 years, and then gradually picks up pace in the last year or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;2.5 years in we were well under $1 million in revenue a year, probably $200,000-$300,000 in revenue per year. At 2.5 years we had about 500 users. Now we have 100,000 users (7 years in).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we switched from Euros to American dollars, that week we saw a huge increase in sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How come America still seems to be the place where web apps thrive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The environment in America is different than Europe. There are bigger entrepreneurial hubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early days, one of the things that set us apart was the designed of the software. I&#8217;m not sure how replicable this would be now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a company that has side-projects: we build other apps that (if successful) we roll into our main product.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the show today is one of the best bootstrappers in the business: <a href="http://twitter.com/salted">Paul Farnell</a> of <a href="http://www.litmus.com/?utm_source=productpeople&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=ep22">Litmus.com</a> joins me and shares some great stories.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;My parents didn&#8217;t want me to have a games console; they wanted something that I could create things on. My first computer was an Amiga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was inspired by my dad. I started publishing a magazine myself, and distributing it in my middle-school. We even sold annual subscriptions! (mostly to teachers, because they had more money)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was 12-13 years old, I started building different software products. The first was &#8220;Instant Theme Creator&#8221;. It sold for $19 (although it was always advertised for $29). It was listed on Download.com&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always liked the validation of someone finding enough value in something that I built they were willing to pay for it. I didn&#8217;t want to just make a magazine that people would read, I wanted to make&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many hacks that we technical people do every day. We don&#8217;t always think that if we could create systems for other people; make these hacks into products&#8221; &#8211; Justin Jackson</p>
<p>[Did you enjoy business school?] &#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t enjoy the courses (or find it applicable). But it was time well spent: because I had the freedom to build Litmus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so impressed with the design, usability of 37signals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I built the first version of Litmus in a weekend. It was initially called SiteVista.com. It was running a couple of old desktop machines in my dorm, on the college&#8217;s internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was incredibly exciting to see people using the product. You would literally see customers using the product, because they were testing web pages on the screens underneath my desk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It did cause some trouble: my girlfriend would get woken up by the machines under my desk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We programmed the original app in VB script.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched with under 100 people.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>On the show today is one of the best bootstrappers in the business: &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/salted&quot;&gt;Paul Farnell&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.litmus.com/?utm_source=productpeople&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=ep22&quot;&gt;Litmus.com&lt;/a&gt; joins me and shares some great stories.
Highlights
&quot;My parents didn&#039;t want me to have a games console; they wanted something that I could create things on. My first computer was an Amiga.&quot;

&quot;I was inspired by my dad. I started publishing a magazine myself, and distributing it in my middle-school. We even sold annual subscriptions! (mostly to teachers, because they had more money)&quot;

&quot;When I was 12-13 years old, I started building different software products. The first was &quot;Instant Theme Creator&quot;. It sold for $19 (although it was always advertised for $29). It was listed on Download.com&quot;

&quot;I&#039;ve always liked the validation of someone finding enough value in something that I built they were willing to pay for it. I didn&#039;t want to just make a magazine that people would read, I wanted to make&quot;

&quot;There are so many hacks that we technical people do every day. We don&#039;t always think that if we could create systems for other people; make these hacks into products&quot; - Justin Jackson

[Did you enjoy business school?] &quot;No. I didn&#039;t enjoy the courses (or find it applicable). But it was time well spent: because I had the freedom to build Litmus.&quot;

&quot;I was so impressed with the design, usability of 37signals.&quot;

&quot;I built the first version of Litmus in a weekend. It was initially called SiteVista.com. It was running a couple of old desktop machines in my dorm, on the college&#039;s internet.&quot;

&quot;It was incredibly exciting to see people using the product. You would literally see customers using the product, because they were testing web pages on the screens underneath my desk.&quot;

&quot;It did cause some trouble: my girlfriend would get woken up by the machines under my desk.&quot;

&quot;We programmed the original app in VB script.&quot;

&quot;We launched with under 100 people.&quot;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we have part 2 of our interview with <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a> that literally sent warning bells blaring through the <a href="http://8bit.io">8Bit</a> office. We also hear about his new Kickstarter campaign: <a href="http://pressgr.am">Pressgram</a> (an iOS app that allows you to take filtered photos, and publish them to your WordPress blog).</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;Without deadlines you just never know if there&#8217;s progress, or to measure momentum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without deadlines you won&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve succeeded in doing anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without personal deadlines you can be slaving away on something and never launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have partners you will have more fun, you will make more money, and you will have more margin than without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you&#8217;re a magical unicorn that can do all things, you&#8217;re probably going to be a specialist (a designer, business person, developer). Startups need specialists that are kicking butt at being excellent in particular areas, than a bunch of generalists doing everything mediocre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors want to invest in people that are at the top of their game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t launched because there&#8217;s something in this product that you can overcome without help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding good people is about experimenting.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While in Boston, <a href="http://jasonevanish.com">Jason Evanish</a> made a name for himself as a customer-focused entrepreneur. He caught the eye of <a href="http://hitenism.com">Hiten Shah</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com">KISSmetrics</a>. Hiten asked Jason to leave Boston, and move to the Valley to become KISSmetric&#8217;s Product Manager.</p>
<p>Since then, he&#8217;s become known as a generous teacher; especially when it comes to customer development, pattern matching, and product development.</p>
<p>In this candid interview, Jason shares what he&#8217;s learned so far leading product at KISSmetrics.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&#8220;Your assumptions are not necessarily true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Customer development is a series of tactics to get to the core of what a customer really is. You find out what there problem is, and create a solution that can really delight them. The challenge is that customers won&#8217;t flat out tell you what they need. You need a process to draw it out of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to get the politics out of your organization, become a data-driven company. Now you have numbers and data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people think customer development is highly subjective. The key is you need to trust the interpreter. If you were having someone translate from Chinese to English, you would need to trust the person doing the interpretation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of data should you track? Look at feature adoption rates: what do people actually use?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we have <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/writers/jf">Jason Fried</a> of 37signals on the program. We discuss how he made thousands of dollars in high school, why he chose <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com">DHH</a> as a partner, what it&#8217;s like to be &#8220;internet famous&#8221;, and the thinking behind the <a href="http://basecamp.com">new Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com/breeze">Basecamp Breeze</a> and <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A quick note about the audio quality of this show: </strong>Jason had a bad WiFi connection that caused Skype to drop out at numerous times in the interview. We felt like the content was good, and so we released the show (even though the audio is not up to our standard). In order to serve you the listener, we paid to have a transcript made so you can read the interview. You can see this at: <a href="http://productpeople.tv/jasonfried">productpeople.tv/jasonfried</a></p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>Justin Jackson: [0:01] Hi, I&#8217;m Justin.</p>
<p>Kyle Fox: [0:02] And I&#8217;m Kyle.</p>
<p>Justin: [0:03] This is Product People. The podcast focused on great products and the people who make them.</p>
<p>Kyle: [0:10] This is a pretty exciting episode because our guest today is Jason Fried of 37signals. Of course, 37signals is the company behind Basecamp and a bunch of other popular products as well as the bestselling book Rework. Jason it&#8217;s a pleasure to have you today, thanks for taking your time to talk to us.</p>
<p>Jason Fried: [0:31] Thanks for having me on guys.</p>
<p>Justin: [0:33] Perfect. Well, Jason you guys have been really busy at 37signals. You have built a bunch of new stuff this year but before we get into all that I want to now, have you always been making products? Is this something you have been doing, you know, since you started 37signals or was there stuff you built and sold before that?</p>
<p>Jason: [0:55] When I first got started in computers I was in junior high school, I&#8217;m 38 now, so I guess that was, I don&#8217;t know, 25 years ago or something that I got a computer. I started messing around with it and one of the things I wanted to do was I wanted to keep track of all the different tapes and CDs that I had.</p>
<p>[1:21] So I eventually got on AOL, before the formal Internet was around, went to the file section, searched in the Mac section for like music organizing tools and I found some stuff and downloaded those things. They were mostly based in FileMaker Pro, which is a data base. I had FileMaker Pro so I could run them and I just didn&#8217;t like them. I don&#8217;t know what it was, they weren&#8217;t attractive, they weren&#8217;t easy to use, they were complicated, they were doing far more things than I needed.</p>
<p>[1:59] I just needed this really simple thing. I wanted to look good, and be fast. I ended up just figuring that I could figure out how to make this sort of thing myself. I had File Maker, I started screwing around, started learning how to do it, and I eventually made a product called Audio File, which I started using to catalog my music collection.</p>
<p>[2:21] I basically wrote a little text file, a read me file basically, and in there I said, &#8220;Hey, if you like this it&#8217;s $20.00. Send me a check, or send me $20.00&#8221; and I put my address down. Then I uploaded it to AOL, and see what would happen. I had no idea.</p>
<p>[2:41] Then one day I got a check in the mail, well I got an envelope in the mail from a guy in Germany, and I didn&#8217;t know anybody in Germany. I hadn&#8217;t heard of anyone from Germany, I had never been there. And so my parents gave me this envelope, this air mail envelope, and I open it, and there was a print out of that read me file and $20.00.</p>
<p>[2:59] That was the start for me of selling software. After that I started taking off, and it didn&#8217;t put me through college or anything, but I had a nice amount of spending money, extra spending money in college just from this $20.00 shareware tool that I made. I probably made 10s of thousands of dollars or more selling it over the next few years.</p>
<p>Justin: [3:22] You&#8217;re kidding me, actually 10s of thousands of dollars selling this little shareware app?</p>
<p>Jason: [3:27] Yes, 10s of thousands of dollars, $20.00 a pop.</p>
<p>Justin: [3:31] What was it like, did that seem significant to you? I would love to make $10,000.00 now as a high school kid, was that pretty significant?</p>
<p>Jason: [3:41] Oh yeah. I&#8217;ve always had jobs too, so I&#8217;ve been working since I was 13 at grocery stores and shoe stores and gas stations and all this stuff. I had part time jobs anyway. I would have had spending money, but it was great to have extra money coming in, to have a significant amount, and for it to be sort of this passive money in that I didn&#8217;t feel like I was working for it. I had already done the work, making software.</p>
<p>Justin: [4:11] Yeah.</p>
<p>Jason: [4:12] The money just kept coming in, unlike my part time jobs where I had to go after school and work for four hours or something every day. That was a real nice thing. It was great. It was killer. I bought a bunch of stuff I wanted like a stereo or whatever, just a bunch of garbage probably.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>Jason: [4:33] But I bought stuff because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got some money to buys stuff.&#8221; Then in college it came in handy because I didn&#8217;t work during college so I needed some money to spend. That was handy. Yeah, it was great. It was a revelation.</p>
<p>[4:43] The thing I realized early on is people are happy to pay for things that are good. Don&#8217;t be afraid to charge for your services. Don&#8217;t be afraid to charge for what you produce. If those people who don&#8217;t want to pay for it want to complain about it, that&#8217;s fine. They don&#8217;t have to buy it.</p>
<p>[5:01] There are plenty of people out there who appreciate something good and are happy to cough up some cash for it, because they think it&#8217;s worth their time and it makes their life better.</p>
<p>Justin: [5:11] Yeah. What did your folks think about that when this is going on and you&#8217;re in high school? Are you from an entrepreneurial family?</p>
<p>Jason: [5:20] Sort of. My grandfather started a grocery store chain way back when, so he was working on his own. My dad worked for someone else for a while, but then he was working on his own, so a little bit of that.</p>
<p>[5:37] I had always kind of felt like I&#8217;d be an entrepreneur at some level. My dad always encouraged me to be that way. The making money thing from this software thing on this thing called AOL, my parents didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Justin: [5:47] Yeah.</p>
<p>Jason: [5:48] And I kind of was surprised too, but they just kept seeing checks coming in the mail for me. Whenever I&#8217;d get home from school or something there&#8217;d be a pile of envelopes for me.</p>
<p>Justin: [laughs] [5:58]</p>
<p>Jason: [5:59] They liked it at a certain point, obviously.</p>
<p>Justin: [6:04] That&#8217;s hilarious. If I all of a sudden had $10,000 in envelopes, my parents would have some questions for me.</p>
<p>Jason: [laughs] [6:10] Well, of course, this is spread out over 10 years, but, yeah. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; I showed them. &#8220;I made this thing, and people are paying for it.&#8221; They understood that part of it. They didn&#8217;t understand what the thing was, but they got, yeah, people pay for things they want to buy. &#8220;OK, people are paying for it. Good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin: [6:28] That&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>Kyle: [6:30] How old did you say you were when you first did this?</p>
<p>Jason: [6:34] You know, I can&#8217;t exactly remember but I feel like I was, I started doing the computer stuff in junior high and then I feel it was probably sometime in high school when I actually released the product.</p>
<p>[crosstalk]</p>
<p>Kyle: [6:50] OK</p>
<p>Jason: [6:51] &#8230;audio file product. I think, it&#8217;s been so long I don&#8217;t remember the exact years. But I started before I went to college and I kept it going through college and I sort of stopped after that.</p>
<p>Kyle: [7:02] Got you! That&#8217;s got to be quite a revelation for a late adolescent kid. I know around that time is sort of when I got a part time job after school and this whole idea of, hey! I&#8217;m going to, I guess this is just how the world works. You kind of trade your hours for dollars sort of thing. [laughs] Meanwhile you were seeing the opposite side of the spectrum. You build this thing one time and collect mad checks.</p>
<p>[7:27] So what was that like as, I imagine not many of your friends were doing something like that. They were kind of like doing the old thing.</p>
<p>Jason: [7:36] Well, you know, I always had tried to sell other things too. I got a reseller&#8217;s license when I was, I think, 14 or 15. I went with my dad downtown somewhere. I don&#8217;t remember all the details either. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p>[7:53] We got this license that allowed me to buy things from distributors at cost, and then I could resell them to my friends for like double because it was still cheaper than it would have been to get stuff from the store. If it wasn&#8217;t double it was like I&#8217;d make 50 percent.</p>
<p>[8:10] I had friends who were buying cordless phones from me and radar detectors for the car and stuff. At the store it was like $200, and I paid like $110 and sold it for like $160 or something, so I made $50.</p>
<p>[8:22] I&#8217;ve always been into the buying and selling and business side of things. The thing that was cool about software was that I felt like the majority of the effort was up front, and the payments came afterward, which I kind of liked compared to doing a reseller thing where you have to go buy inventory and sell it and then you have to go buy more inventory. You&#8217;re always working hard for the same amount of money instead of putting in a lot of that creativity up front and then reaping the rewards down the road.</p>
<p>Kyle: [8:55] Right, yeah, it totally makes sense. If we were to fast forward a little bit to the start of 37Signals, you guys started off as a design agency. Correct?</p>
<p>Jason: [9:08] That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Kyle: [9:09] So that would be a little bit different, I guess, than selling a product where you do all this upfront work and then collect on it sort of over the life of the product. So you started as a design agency but eventually transitioned into your first product, Basecamp.</p>
<p>[9:24] Do you want to talk about what that was like, going from agency to creating a product? What prompted you guys to build Basecamp? Was the idea of changing into a product company something you guys had from the start, or was it sort of like &#8220;Let&#8217;s build this and see what happens?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason: [9:42] Basecamp came from our own need. We were a consulting firm and doing website design for people. We just got busier and busier doing that work. We needed a better way to manage these projects we were doing for clients.</p>
<p>[9:56] We were basically delivering things via email, which is fine. It works, but it just didn&#8217;t feel that, I don&#8217;t know, profession is the word I used. I don&#8217;t like that word today, but back then I was like, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t feel professional&#8221; or something.</p>
<p>[10:12] There was no permanent record of things. It was just in in-boxes spread out all over the place. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;There&#8217;s got to be a better way to do this sort of thing.&#8221; So we looked around at some tools that existed in the market, but they weren&#8217;t really solving the problems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very similar to me way back in the day looking for music cataloging tools. I couldn&#8217;t find something that did what I needed it to do. All these things were doing other things that I didn&#8217;t need, so we decided to build our own project management tool [inaudible 00: [10:26] 10:42] .</p>
<p>[10:45] As we were building it we were using it. We were using it with our clients, and they were saying things like, &#8220;Hey, I need this sort of thing too. What is this? I&#8217;ve got projects. I need to manage my projects. Where I can I buy this thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>We said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re building this thing. You&#8217;re helping us figure it out as we go.&#8221; So [inaudible 00: [11:03] 11:05] goes off and goes, &#8220;Hey, maybe this is a product.&#8221; We finished it up, used it some more, and then polished it up to turn it into a product and then put some prices on it and threw it back out there. We made a website and talked about it on our blog and released it in February 2004 with a goal that if it could make $5000 a month after the first year.</p>
<p>[11:34] We figured it would take a year for it to make $5000 a month, but we&#8217;d be happy because that&#8217;s about $60,000 a year which is like a nice client project. We&#8217;d be doing our client work, and we&#8217;d have this &#8220;free money&#8221; this free $60,000 coming in every year.</p>
<p>[11:43] It turned out that we hit that number in like five, six, seven, eight weeks, something like that. I don&#8217;t remember the exact time. It didn&#8217;t take a year. It took like a month or two months, and it was doing more than $5000 a month. So we knew we were onto something.</p>
<p>[12:03] It just turned out that a year later it was doing more money than our consulting business was, so we stopped doing the consulting stuff and started doing product development, not developing products but just focused on Basecamp. The rest is sort of history for that.</p>
<p>Kyle: [12:11] Right, yeah. Cool.</p>
<p>Justin: [12:13] So, Jason, maybe we can talk a little bit about&#8230;because along that time you met this guy named David Heinemeier Hansson. Maybe actually you can give Kyle and I some advice, because him and I are new partners on this podcast.</p>
<p>[12:33] It&#8217;s similar. We met each other online, and now we&#8217;ve got a little bit of revenue. I think in some ways Kyle and I are at the point where we&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Do we want to actually partner up for real and make this official?&#8221; How did you go through that process with David?</p>
<p>Jason: [12:52] Well, I originally hired David. He was in school at the time and I hired him to give me 10 hours a week. Actually, let me step back because that&#8217;s actually not accurate. Actually there&#8217;s something before that.</p>
<p>[13:00] I hired him to do a project for me. I&#8217;d been working on a program in PHP and I made a thing called Single File which is a book collection database. I made it and I was kind of getting stuck and so I asked some people for some help and David was one of the people who heard about that I needed help.</p>
<p>[13:31] He wrote me an email and started helping me back and forth. This is just free, like advice. And then like, I really like this guy, his advice and how clear he is and whatever. So I hired him to do that project for me, to finish that tool.</p>
<p>Justin: [13:44] OK.</p>
<p>Jason: [13:45] It worked out really well. That was the first project we did together. Then this other project came up at 37signals, which was an Internet project for a client of ours, called Summit Credit Union. We were doing the redesign, then we said, hey, maybe we can add some awesome functionality to it.</p>
<p>[14:08] I said, &#8220;Hey David, would you be the programmer on this, we will do the design, you the programming and we will sell this thing.&#8221; He said sure, he was a student, he was looking for money. We worked together on that project, which was a great project, we worked on some other projects like that.</p>
<p>[14:25] He was getting out of school, we were talking and so I hired him as a contractor to do Basecamp, then hired him as an employee and then from the employee he eventually became a partner in the business. It was a series of tasks basically, but they weren&#8217;t really tasks.</p>
<p>[14:41] Looking back it looks like they were tasks but they were really just experiences working together at a different capacity along the way and realizing that we got along well, we would be good partners in the business. The key was that he was introducing a skill or he was bringing a skill to the table that I didn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>[15:03] So he was a programmer. I was a designer. He wasn&#8217;t a designer. I wasn&#8217;t a programmer. So we complemented each other well which I think is important for partners. So it happened over a series of years, gaining trust working together, and that&#8217;s how it all came together eventually.</p>
<p>Justin: [15:23] Was there any part of you that was still nervous when you made that jump to saying I&#8217;m actually going to give you part of this company that we built? Was there any sort of hesitation, or by that point had you built enough trust to say &#8220;I trust this guy. We can go ahead on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason: [15:43] Well, there was hesitation just because it&#8217;s a big step to do the&#8230;I&#8217;ve had a couple of partners before at 37 Signals and, at this point, I was back on my own again at 37 Signals, so it&#8217;s a couple of things. One didn&#8217;t work out really and the other guy just left a few years later.</p>
<p>[16:05] They were all good amicable separations but I&#8217;m back to my own again. Do I want to go back in this whole partner thing again? Do I want down that road again? So there was that, of course. But I could tell that David was a special, unique guy and that had we not partnered up he would have gone off to do his own thing. So I kind of saw it as a bigger risk not to get him more involved. I also thought that he would contribute a lot more as an owner and everything.</p>
<p>[16:49] While there was that initial sort of, do I really want to go down this partner thing road again, there was also the, yes, this makes sense, I&#8217;m going to take a risk, I&#8217;m going to bet on this guy and believe in him, and I&#8217;ll make a bet and see what happens. It was good obviously.</p>
<p>Justin: [17:02] Yeah. It paid off.</p>
<p>Jason: [17:04] Yep.</p>
<p>Justin: [17:04] Well, maybe one last question in kind of just the background story. When you guys started doing Basecamp and started blogging, you were kind of the underdogs. No one really knew who you were and your biggest competitor was Microsoft in the project management space. But now, especially in the tech community, a lot of people know who you are.</p>
<p>[17:34] How does it feel to have all of this attention now? What&#8217;s it like? Has it changed from when you first started and does it make it harder? Does it make it easier? Do you like the attention? What&#8217;s that like?</p>
<p>Jason: [17:50] I don&#8217;t really think about it. I know that we have the ability to get attention by saying things or announcing things, but it doesn&#8217;t affect our decisions day to day. People do care about what we are doing, some people love it, some people hate it. The point is if we have something to say, people will listen. So, that&#8217;s good, that&#8217;s a huge advantage.</p>
<p>[18:23] But day to day, I don&#8217;t think about it. Personally I&#8217;m more of a private guy, I don&#8217;t like to seek attention and I would rather be at home, I&#8217;m kind of an introverted person. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I don&#8217;t like conferences and stuff. I don&#8217;t really want the attention, I just want to do great work and build cool stuff and that is what I was doing.</p>
<p>[18:50] One of the things is of course when more people know about you their expectations are different. In many ways it&#8217;s very hard to meet those expectations on a consistent basis when they have their own expectations that are sort of impossible to meet.</p>
<p>[19:16] When you&#8217;re releasing your product it&#8217;s very easy to go is that all? Is that all they could do? Is that it? You know that sort of thing which you wouldn&#8217;t get that normally if you were brand new. So there is a little bit of that stuff, but for the most part it&#8217;s great. I mean it&#8217;s great to have the ability to not have to pay for attention because we&#8217;ve earned it over the years. That&#8217;s definitely helpful.</p>
<p>Interviewer: [19:40] Well this segue ways into something that Kyle was asking me about. What was, with the Basecamp relaunch, right Kyle?</p>
<p>Kyle: [19:53] I think it&#8217;s been close to a year since you guys relaunched Basecamp correct? I think you launched in the start of March 2012.</p>
<p>Jason: [20:01] That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Kyle: [20:05] I&#8217;ve worked in the past at places where we&#8217;ve decided to rebuild the product from scratch. It ends up being good but it&#8217;s also in some ways never really as good as you imagined or it takes a little bit longer. Some people tend to say you should never rebuild your product. Which I don&#8217;t personally think, but there&#8217;s a pretty strong following for that line of thinking.</p>
<p>[20:32] I&#8217;d be curious to know, now that you guys are a year into it, looking back on it what originally prompted you guys to take on this huge risk of rebuilding a successful product and how did it go? Did it take longer than you might have thought or have you been overall happy with how this went?</p>
<p>Jason: [20:54] It was a pretty [inaudible 00:20:56] mostly between me and David initially. The new Basecamp was my idea. I want to build a new Basecamp, let&#8217;s start over, let&#8217;s solve similar problems but new ways. I started working on this. And this typically happened [inaudible 00:21:13] I&#8217;ll have some idea and I&#8217;ll just start mocking it up and screwing around and whatever.</p>
<p>[21:17] And then I&#8217;ll show Dave and get his feedback on it. Because David has really insightful take on things and he also reacts quickly which is good and bad. But really good when you&#8217;re showing him because good to see quick reactions on things.</p>
<p>[21:38] Anyway, I go off on my own and work with another designer or something and do something and then I show David. Actually David wasn&#8217;t convinced because he&#8217;s always thought, like you mentioned, and it&#8217;s sort of said in the industry that total rewrites are usually a huge mistake. They usually don&#8217;t turn out as well as they should. It&#8217;s a ton of time spent for very little return. It&#8217;s like the curse of software development.</p>
<p>[22:07] He was naturally opposed to that, which I totally understood, too. I was talking to him like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not get stuck not doing something because we&#8217;re not supposed to. Let&#8217;s try something and see if we can do something that we&#8217;re not supposed to. Let&#8217;s not stop doing it because we&#8217;re not supposed to. Let&#8217;s start doing it because we&#8217;re not supposed to and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>[22:32] We went back to the drawing board to look over some stuff. He had some really good feedback on a few things. I went back, changed the design around, messed around, went to him again. We started seeing where it was going and then got really excited about it.</p>
<p>[22:46] The idea behind it was not to recreate Basecamp that we already had. That&#8217;s what happens with a lot of rewrites. A team would rewrite a product. What will come out of it is the exact same product with a new code base. That&#8217;s not worth the time.</p>
<p>[23:02] We were going to approach the same problems, which was communication and collaboration, and sharing information and keeping it all on one place online and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Kyle: [23:11] Right.</p>
<p>Jason: [23:12] Priorities. That&#8217;s why it made sense.</p>
<p>Kyle: [23:18] Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s a perfect example of when it does make sense to possibly do a rewrite. When a lot of people say to not do a rewrite or it&#8217;s a mistake is, I think because, in a lot of cases, when a company decides to do a rewrite the decision is technology based, like let&#8217;s migrate from this old technology stack to a newer technology stack because of these technology reasons.</p>
<p>[23:45] In you guys&#8217; case it sounds like you learned a lot and gained a lot of insight from running Basecamp, the first version, and it probably gave you some different ways to approach the problems. It&#8217;s kind of like a problem solving reason to approach a rebuild rather than technology.</p>
<p>Jason: [24:09] Yeah, we have gotten to use a lot of new technology. One of the reasons why we couldn&#8217;t improve&#8230;one of the reasons we talked about was could we take these ideas that we come up with and sort of fix Basecamp the classic, the original Basecamp. Could we change it in these ways?</p>
<p>It just turns out that when you have a product that&#8217;s been around for years, there is so much [inaudible 00: [24:27] 24:31] built up, technology wise and also customer expectation. If you go off and change it drastically it really ends up being very difficult.</p>
<p>[24:40] So we decided to keep the old Basecamp which we renamed classic around forever. As long as people are using it, it&#8217;s going to stick around. A lot of people still use it. But we&#8217;re going to focus our efforts on the new Basecamp, new tech, new ideas, the whole thing, and run both versions.</p>
<p>[24:56] When you&#8217;re a new customer you only get the new one. Anyone who is on the old one can stay on the old one, or they can move if they want. It took about a year to do. We wanted to take a little bit less time. We thought it might take six months originally or something. We made a lot of plans and we went and changed a lot of things and did some stuff and worked for months on something and threw it out and things like that.</p>
<p>[25:22] We went back and forth. But I&#8217;m extremely happy with how it came out. Aside from the original decision to make Basecamp, it&#8217;s the best decision as a company we&#8217;ve ever made to redo it. I think it gives us a lot of opportunity to do some really interesting things moving forward as well.</p>
<p>[25:38] We&#8217;re really thrilled with it, customers are loving it, the numbers that we care about are all up. It put us back up on the map which was good for us too because we built this thing eight years ago and that&#8217;s long time ago. So it&#8217;s good to show that we can do something like this.</p>
<p>Justin: [25:59] In the last few minutes we have here I want to talk about Basecamp Breeze and Basecamp Personal. Because you recently got rid of a bunch of products that were low cost or for consumers like Draft, Backpack, Ta-da, and Writeboard. I was a little bit surprised when you guys came out with these two personal products. I think they&#8217;re both, you just pay once and you can use it forever.</p>
<p>Jason: [26:31] Right.</p>
<p>Kyle: [26:32] What was the thinking behind that? Why launch these products aimed at consumers?</p>
<p>Jason: [26:37] Well, they&#8217;re not really aimed at consumers necessarily. Let&#8217;s kind of throw that word just for a second. The idea behind these two products was we were actually setting up some mailing lists. I was realizing how complicated it is to set up a mailing list. It&#8217;s kind of ridiculous how hard it is.</p>
<p>[26:57] Google lists, or Google groups, and Yahoo groups and stuff. You can do it, it&#8217;s just they&#8217;re really complicated for just simple things, which is I just want an email address I can send an email to and have everyone get it. Anyone who responds to that email it goes to everyone else too. That&#8217;s all I wanted.</p>
<p>[27:11] A lot of people actually use Basecamp this way. A lot of people use Basecamp as a mailing list where they&#8217;ll post messages and it gets sent out to everybody and the whole thing. So we just said what if we totally strip this out and built a real simple mailing list tool as sort of an experiment in single pay software. Everything else we&#8217;ve ever really done has been subscription based.</p>
<p>Could we make something that was so damn simple and [inaudible 00: [27:37] 27:40] and just see what happens. We did that and that&#8217;s what Basecamp Breeze. The idea maybe is that perhaps people cross over to Basecamp when they hear about Basecamp Breeze. They&#8217;ll check it out, they&#8217;ll get on a list, they&#8217;ll find it out, they&#8217;ll follow a URL and they&#8217;ll find out hey, there&#8217;s this other Basecamp thing. It&#8217;s a little bit of a marketing experiment and a pricing experiment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kind of [inaudible 00: [28:02] 28:02] all about. Basecamp Personal on the other hand is a direct response to customers asking us if they can use Basecamp for personal projects or projects for their volunteer group or church group or something. Because they want to use Basecamp for that, but the pricing model just doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s too expensive.</p>
<p>[28:22] And the subscription model isn&#8217;t a good model for a home renovation project, which might take six months, or a month, who knows, and it can get really expensive to keep going.</p>
<p>[28:33] We had this idea that we could basically sell individual Basecamp projects for 25 bucks each, and you can use them as long as you want. You only have to pay 25 bucks. There&#8217;s some limitations, like there&#8217;s only a gig of space, and you can only invite five people. There&#8217;s no calendar, and some other stuff.</p>
<p>[28:56] It&#8217;s pointed currently, at people who already use &#8220;Basecamp.&#8221; Already know &#8220;Basecamp.&#8221; They don&#8217;t have to be sold on it, they love it already at work, but they want to use it for other stuff. It&#8217;s just 25 bucks, one time, per project.</p>
<p>[29:07] That was a fun experiment. That&#8217;s an example of selling the same product, in a different way. We didn&#8217;t have to change the code base really. We just pulled some stuff out. It&#8217;s the same exact code base, Basecamp Personal, and Basecamp are the same thing. It&#8217;s just a different pricing model, and there&#8217;s some different walls up in different places.</p>
<p>[29:26] So far, Basecamp Personal has been really successfully sold, close to a 1000 projects. That&#8217;s like $25,000 in less than a month, just putting this thing out there, barely making any noise about it. Pretty soon we&#8217;re going to open it up to everyone in the world. Right now it&#8217;s only available to Basecamp customers. We&#8217;re going to let anyone create their own Basecamp project soon, but for now it&#8217;s just focus on existing customers.</p>
<p>Justin: [29:52] I&#8217;d love to check-up on you in a year, and see if there was a marketing benefit from that. If there was a crossover from Breeze and Personal. That would be interesting.</p>
<p>Jason: [30:04] Yeah, I&#8217;m curious. I don&#8217;t know, we don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just a guess. It&#8217;s way too early to say anyway, but yeah, maybe in a year we&#8217;ll know more.</p>
<p>Kyle: [30:13] All right. We&#8217;re just about out of time here. I thought maybe we would end with one last quick question.</p>
<p>Jason: [30:20] , what sort of advice would you offer for a solo product creator? Based on your experience, should they may be set out to build a full SaaS app like Basecamp? Do you think there&#8217;s a market for smaller products like Breeze? Like a one off, one price, a little bit smaller scope. Where would be a good place for somebody to start?</p>
<p>Jason: [30:43] It&#8217;s hard to say, but what I can tell you is that Basecamp Breeze on its own, would not support anybody. It&#8217;s 10 bucks. Let&#8217;s just say we even sold 10 thousand Breeze accounts. That&#8217;s 100 grand, which is nice obviously, but we haven&#8217;t sold 10 thousand. We have to sell a lot more to get even close to that.</p>
<p>[31:10] It would be very hard to make enough money selling one off things like this, that need ongoing support. It&#8217;s different when you&#8217;re talking about an iPhone app, or something, where you sell once. You&#8217;re not supporting the server, and the infrastructure. It&#8217;s just the app.</p>
<p>If you want to go down the one price road, to start, I wouldn&#8217;t build a Web app that does that, because that requires 24/7 up-time, and that kind of stuff. We&#8217;re fortunate that we have that [inaudible 00: [31:27] 31:40] structure already set-up, so we can do that sort of thing, and experiment with that sort of thing. But it&#8217;s not going to support someone very long.</p>
<p>[31:49] I would definitely suggest to people if they&#8217;re going to build their first product, and maybe they&#8217;re just on their own right now, to try something with recurring revenue. Because it will take a lot of the pressure off making sure the bills get paid and that you have some money to spend yourself. You can control the cash flow a lot more, and I just think that&#8217;s a better place to start. I think once you have a successful customer base and infrastructure you can really start to experiment with single pressing options and stuff like that.</p>
<p>[32:21] I also wouldn&#8217;t try and build something very big either. I think you can build something real simple and you could charge 20-30 bucks a month for it if it&#8217;s a solid product. I would also focus on business stuff because businesses are happy to pay for things generally. It doesn&#8217;t need to do a lot, it just needs to be useful. And you can build a nice business that way.</p>
<p>[32:42] I would stay away from the consumer business too as a single product person who&#8217;s starting out because it&#8217;s very hard to get the consumers to pay for things when it comes to software unless it&#8217;s like two bucks. Everyone seems to be stuck with the 99 cents or $2 products now so that&#8217;s what people are used to. Businesses are used to paying a lot of money for things, 20 bucks a month sounds like a huge discount to them so there&#8217;s a lot more opportunity there I think.</p>
<p>Kyle: [33:09] Right. So in summary probably a smaller scope, some kind of recurring product ideally geared towards businesses. That&#8217;s kind of a good place to start.</p>
<p>Jason: [33:21] I think so. Real focused, you know, what do you need as a business owner? In fact, we&#8217;re working on another product right now that we need as a business, and we&#8217;ve been building it for just like about a month really.</p>
<p>[33:34] Well, it&#8217;s been floated longer than that, but really seriously for a month. It&#8217;s just me and one other guy doing it here. We could technically release that product in a few weeks if we wanted to. It is six to eight weeks worth of work, two guys, could probably have been one person.</p>
<p>[33:53] It&#8217;s a tool I think a lot of businesses are going to be interested in paying for. I think it&#8217;s certainly possible to do that. You don&#8217;t have to think that things are going to take you a year to do. If you&#8217;re focused and you do a few things well, then you can be in a good spot.</p>
<p>Justin: [34:05] So we&#8217;ll wait for that, and maybe in two weeks there&#8217;s going to be another product announcement.</p>
<p>Jason: [34:08] No, not in two weeks. It could be technically, but there&#8217;s no chance.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>Jason: [34:14] Yeah, we&#8217;re working on something that&#8217;s going to hopefully be out later this year. I&#8217;m just saying that you really could, technically we could get it out there with eight weeks worth of development. It&#8217;s certainly possible to do that.</p>
<p>Justin: [34:29] You&#8217;re being too conservative. You&#8217;ve got to get it out now. [laughs]</p>
<p>Jason: [34:33] Maybe we&#8217;ll get it out sooner than later. We&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Justin: [34:37] OK. Well, Jason, thanks so much for your time. In the show notes we&#8217;re going to put links to all of Jason&#8217;s contact information, the 37Signals website, and a link to the landing page for the new book that he and David Heinemeier Hansson are working on. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Remote.&#8221; You guys can check that out in the show notes. Jason, thanks so much for taking the time today to talk to us.</p>
<p>Jason: [35:02] You bet. It was really fun. Thanks for having me on, guys. It&#8217;s good to hear from you again, Justin, by the way. We hadn&#8217;t talked in a while.</p>
<p>Justin: [35:07] Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s good to hear from you too.</p>
<p>Jason: [35:09] Cool.</p>
<p>Justin: [35:09] Cool.</p>
<p>Kyle: [35:10] See you later.</p>
<p>Jason: [35:11] Bye now.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/writers/jf&quot;&gt;Jason Fried&lt;/a&gt; of 37signals on the program. We discuss how he made thousands of dollars in high school, why he chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://david.heinemeierhansson.com&quot;&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt; as a partner, what it&#039;s like to be &quot;internet famous&quot;, and the thinking behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://basecamp.com&quot;&gt;new Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://basecamp.com/breeze&quot;&gt;Basecamp Breeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/personal&quot;&gt;Basecamp Personal&lt;/a&gt;.

A quick note about the audio quality of this show: Jason had a bad WiFi connection that caused Skype to drop out at numerous times in the interview. We felt like the content was good, and so we released the show (even though the audio is not up to our standard). In order to serve you the listener, we paid to have a transcript made so you can read the interview. You can see this at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://productpeople.tv/jasonfried&quot;&gt;productpeople.tv/jasonfried&lt;/a&gt;
Shout outs
Here&#039;s something new: it&#039;s called Shout Outs, and it&#039;s an inexpensive way for YOU to sponsor a show. Starting as low as $39 per episode, you can promote anything you want: It could be your bootstrapped startup, a job opening, or a side-project. We&#039;ll read these &quot;shout outs&quot; at the end of each episode. You can get started at &lt;a href=&quot;http://productpeople.tv/shoutout&quot;&gt;productpeople.tv/shoutout&lt;/a&gt;

Transcript
Justin Jackson: [0:01] Hi, I&#039;m Justin.

Kyle Fox: [0:02] And I&#039;m Kyle.

Justin: [0:03] This is Product People. The podcast focused on great products and the people who make them.

Kyle: [0:10] This is a pretty exciting episode because our guest today is Jason Fried of 37signals. Of course, 37signals is the company behind Basecamp and a bunch of other popular products as well as the bestselling book Rework. Jason it&#039;s a pleasure to have you today, thanks for taking your time to talk to us.

Jason Fried: [0:31] Thanks for having me on guys.

Justin: [0:33] Perfect. Well, Jason you guys have been really busy at 37signals. You have built a bunch of new stuff this year but before we get into all that I want to now, have you always been making products? Is this something you have been doing, you know, since you started 37signals or was there stuff you built and sold before that?

Jason: [0:55] When I first got started in computers I was in junior high school, I&#039;m 38 now, so I guess that was, I don&#039;t know, 25 years ago or something that I got a computer. I started messing around with it and one of the things I wanted to do was I wanted to keep track of all the different tapes and CDs that I had.

[1:21] So I eventually got on AOL, before the formal Internet was around, went to the file section, searched in the Mac section for like music organizing tools and I found some stuff and downloaded those things. They were mostly based in FileMaker Pro, which is a data base. I had FileMaker Pro so I could run them and I just didn&#039;t like them. I don&#039;t know what it was, they weren&#039;t attractive, they weren&#039;t easy to use, they were complicated, they were doing far more things than I needed.

[1:59] I just needed this really simple thing. I wanted to look good, and be fast. I ended up just figuring that I could figure out how to make this sort of thing myself. I had File Maker, I started screwing around, started learning how to do it, and I eventually made a product called Audio File, which I started using to catalog my music collection.

[2:21] I basically wrote a little text file, a read me file basically, and in there I said, &quot;Hey,</itunes:summary>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Most of my users don&#8217;t care that [<a href="https://planscope.io">Planscope</a>] is project management software; they care about outcomes.&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
<li>&#8220;Instead of listing out technical features, which is what [we as developers] want to do, I need to tell a story.&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
<li><strong>How did you get people to care? How did you get people to notice your product?</strong>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;My entire marketing strategy is marketing through education. I knew the problems my audience was having, so I started blogging about those problems.&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
<li>&#8220;People don&#8217;t buy software just to buy software: they buy software to make their lives better somehow. A blog post is equally able to do that (to make their lives better).&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What kind of traffic did you get on your blog when you started?</strong>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I got a few thousand views over the months that I was building Planscope&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
<li>&#8220;Blogging allowed me to get out of the code and answer the question: &#8216;Why am I doing this?'&#8221; &#8211; Brennan Dunn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How did you build your email list?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It was a mailing list of 300 people when he launched.</li>
<li>Brennan built his list over the 4 months that he was building Planscope.</li>
<li>Most of the sign-ups to his email list came from his blog.</li>
<li>1/3 of his mailing list signed up for a trial account (100 people)</li>
<li>25% of his trial users converted to paying accounts (25 people)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Where does growth come from?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of Brennan&#8217;s customers have come from his blog posts, and his email list</li>
<li>Another important source of traffic: his book <em><a href="http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com">Double Your Freelancing Rate</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How much money has Brennan earned so far? (as of December)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Planscope &#8211; $29,904 ($6,000 / month)</li>
<li>Books &#8211; $35,00</li>
<li>Classes &#8211; $41,000</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you make a name for yourself, and your product?</strong></p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the question we posed to Brennan Dunn.</strong> It seemed like almost overnight he was everywhere: blog posts on Hacker News, popping up in my Twitter stream, and promoting a new product for consultants called <a href="http://planscope.io">Planscope</a>. In this episode we delve into how he made this happen: we asked him how he got his start in products, how he promoted himself, and what Latin has to do with all of this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered how much personal brand affects software sales? Check out this is great episode with Rob Walling. In our interview he reveals a ton of tactics for <strong>outsourcing your development on oDesk, finding a good idea for your business, and marketing your product effectively</strong>. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to start and launch your own software products as a solo-founder, this episode is full of practical advice you can use. Rob is the founder of <a href="http://hittail.com">HitTail</a>, and co-founder of <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com">Startups for the Rest of Us</a> and the <a href="http://www.micropreneur.com">Micropreneur Academy</a>.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to outsource your work: techniques for oDesk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Browse the listings: look how boring most of the tasks are!</li>
<li>Post an interesting job description</li>
<li>Build relationships, and treat the people you hire well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What makes a good idea, in terms of building a business?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build something people want, solves a problem</strong> (problem-solution fit). Rob recommends Steve Blank&#8217;s customer development approach: contact people, tell them what your product does, how much you&#8217;ll charge, and ask them if they&#8217;ll pay for it. Rob</li>
<li><strong>And you can find that market fairly easily:</strong> if you can&#8217;t communicate to them easily, you don&#8217;t have a business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is the actual genesis of a good idea?</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can solve your own problem: but make sure you validate it with 10 other people. Also, think about how you&#8217;re going to market it to &#8220;people like yourself&#8221;. &#8220;Scratching your own issue isn&#8217;t enough&#8221;, says Rob, &#8220;you have to solve a problem and have a market.&#8221;</li>
<li>You can also find a market that you find interesting, and where you have some sort of traction in. Then you can look for problems to solve. With <a href="http://getdrip.com">Drip</a>, Rob chose it because he really likes working with the entrepreneur market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the characteristics of a good market? (and a bad market)</strong>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;There are no bad markets,&#8221; says Robs, &#8220;some markets are just harder to communicate to than others.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rob likes markets that are online, that talk to each other (virality), and open to trying new things. (For example: Realtors and lawyers are <strong>not</strong><strong> </strong>as<strong> </strong>open to trying new things)</li>
<li>Ability and willingness to pay: don&#8217;t create an app for college students or school teachers! There&#8217;s a lack of an ability to pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Which is better: B2B or B2C?</strong>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I prefer B2B because businesses purchase based on value&#8221;, says Rob, &#8220;if you can save them money or make them money, you can justify your price. Consumers don&#8217;t value their time as much.&#8221;</li>
<li>Should you go after hobby markets? Rob thinks they can work for info-products and mobile apps, but not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS apps</a>.</li>
<li>&#8220;Consumers are harder to support&#8221; &#8211; Rob</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>How to market your product:</b>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal brand:</strong> &#8220;Personal brand has very little to do with B2B sales,&#8221; comments Rob, &#8220;in terms of HitTail&#8217;s growth, most of it has come from other channels.&#8221; He says that books, conferences, and training courses can benefit from a strong personal brand. You have to have an interesting perspective: this is often formed by what you&#8217;ve achieved (personally). What projects and products have you launched? &#8220;The earlier you can be laser focused on a certain audience, the faster you&#8217;ll build a following. Rob started focusing on solo-founders, who were bootstrapping.</li>
<li><strong>Content marketing:</strong> this is building info graphics, writing viral blog posts that get shared: it&#8217;s socially driven. It can be really effective: The problem with this approach is that it&#8217;s time-intensive and can be expensive. Look for long-tail search terms: these are low competition phrases, that can still attract a significant amount of traffic. <a href="http://hittail.com">This is why Rob bought HitTail</a>: it surfaces those long-tail keywords for you. Rob currently has his Product Manager do a lot of writing for him, he outsources other things (like the infographic). Rob outsources as much as possible. &#8220;Be sure to measure&#8221;, says Rob, put out a lot of content and then look at the ROI for each.</li>
<li><strong>SEO:</strong> this is finding keywords, and writing good content that matches those keywords. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t just ranking in Google; it includes ranking in Amazon, in YouTube, in the iPhone app store, ranking in WordPress theme directory. It&#8217;s really hard to contract out SEO. &#8220;What has always worked is writing good content,&#8221; says Rob, &#8220;start with keywords that people are going to be searching for, blog about it, and then get links to those posts. It is a lot of work.&#8221; There&#8217;s not as much opportunity to game Google.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising:</strong> It&#8217;s hard to get right, but it can really grow your customer base. &#8220;You really want to have a customer lifetime value over $150 to even look at advertising&#8221;, says Rob. Click advertising has gotten really expensive (especially on Google Adwords). New opportunities: Facebook ads, depending on your market BuySellAds, Reddit ads, LinkedIn (you need a higher lifetime value for it), and StumbleUpon ads. Rob manages all of his advertising campaigns in Google Analytics &#8211; use the <a href="http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1033867">Google URL Builder</a> to identify which campaign you&#8217;re running.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of our interview with Sacha Greif. In this episode we talked with him about how to find a partner, and the pain involved in building up a product income.</p>
<p>Sacha is a designer and coder from Paris, France, but he&#8217;s now living in Osaka, Japan. He&#8217;s worked with companies like Hipmunk, but he&#8217;s best known for his cool side-projects. His most recent, called Telescope, is an open source platform for creating your own Hacker News.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>

		<itunes:summary>This is part 2 of our interview with Sacha Greif. In this episode we talked with him about how to find a partner, and the pain involved in building up a product income.

Sacha is a designer and coder from Paris, France, but he&#039;s now living in Osaka, Japan. He&#039;s worked with companies like Hipmunk, but he&#039;s best known for his cool side-projects. His most recent, called Telescope, is an open source platform for creating your own Hacker News.

In Part 1 of our interview with Sacha we discuss what he learned launching his first book, and what he plans on doing next time. We also take a look at <a href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor</a>, &#8220;an open-source platform for building web apps&#8221; using pure JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sacha kick-started his product career by selling themes on <a href="http://themeforest.net">Themeforest</a>. &#8220;I was doing products before I knew I was doing products.&#8221;</li>
<li>His first real solo product was his ebook: <a href="http://sachagreif.com/ebook/">Step by Step UI Design</a>. <strong>He recommends starting small:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t set out to write a 200 page book. I set out to write a 40 page book.&#8221;</li>
<li>Sacha based the price of his book on what iOS apps were selling for ($2-$5): &#8220;It turns out, that&#8217;s a bad way to do pricing.&#8221; For his next book, he&#8217;s going to employ a higher price strategy (<a href="http://nathanbarry.com/webapps/">similar to what Nathan Barry did for his ebook</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4909784">People on Hacker News balked at Nathan&#8217;s high ebook prices</a>. Sacha thinks: &#8220;People don&#8217;t understand how segmentation works. If you want to buy a car, you could buy a Ferrari or a Honda. You know those two cars are for different audiences. No one complains about the price of Ferraris; people understand that they are expensive. It&#8217;s the same with ebooks; just like you can buy a cheap car or expensive car, you can buy a cheap [ebook] package or expensive package. If you think the expensive package is too expensive, it just means you are not the target audience.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Sacha on segmentation:</strong> &#8220;People think it&#8217;s crazy that Nathan Barry is charging $200 for his ebook package; but they&#8217;re not the target audience. He doesn&#8217;t want you [the individual] to pay that; but rather the office manager at the big company (who isn&#8217;t spending his own money) to purchase it.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>How Sacha plans on promoting his next book:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;ve started setting up a mailing list on the <a href="http://telesc.pe/">Telescope site</a>. There&#8217;s a small sign-up form for the book&#8217;s mailing list on there. I&#8217;ll be sending sample chapters to these people and asking them for feedback.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor</a> is a step above [other frameworks]. I think it&#8217;s the future,&#8221; says Sacha.</li>
<li>&#8220;I wanted to build a Hacker News for designers; because I think that&#8217;s missing right now&#8221;, comments Sacha. This project became <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar.io</a>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to build a software product that actually earns income?</p>
<p>In this (Part 2) episode Patrick McKenzie (Patio11) shares specific tactics for researching a market and finding a problem to solve. <a href="http://media.strongcaster.com/productpeople/ep006-productpeople.mp3">Listen now</a>.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t think up a cool product idea, go and spend months developing it, and then try to find customers. It won&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>Instead, go out and talk to people and see if you can find 5 people who will buy it.</li>
<li>Trick for interviewing people in potential markets: tell them you&#8217;ll pay them their normal rate, but instead of getting their service, you get to ask them questions about their industry (Patio11 interviewed massage therapists and stylists this way)</li>
<li>Be relentlessly curious: ask people about their business problems.</li>
<li>&#8220;Businesses have a lot more money. The people who are responsible for making a purchasing decision in the business aren&#8217;t spending their own money; the office manager at a business is very not reluctant to spend 200 dollars a month of that business&#8217; money.&#8221;</li>
<li>Avoid the education and hobbyist markets: Patrick loves Dungeons and Dragons, but doesn&#8217;t think you can make much income by building software products for D&amp;D players.</li>
<li>&#8220;There&#8217;s different types of pain: you want to be solving a problem where people know they have the problem and are actively looking for solutions, rather than something that the pain is bearable, or is just considered so endemic to the condition that they are not actively trying to get better at that.&#8221;</li>
<li>Have the humility to talk to people and find out what they really want.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>(courtesy of <a href="http://twitter.com/patio11">Patio11</a>: thanks so much!)</p>
<pre>Justin: Huh. That is so fascinating. Basically, in 2010, you were able to stop working at the day job and just live on product income.

Patrick: Right.

Justin: Was there a portion of that that was consulting, as well, or was that all, you quit because you were making enough on the product?

Patrick: I quit because I was making enough on the product. But there's an asterisk there with regards to consulting stuff. Bingo Card Creator is highly seasonal, because it tracks the school year. Sales go down every summer. I was quitting in April.

I thought, OK, I know I'm fine until the school year ends. Then, summer's going to be interesting. Either I'm going to be burning savings or having to subsist on credit cards until the school year starts up again.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: But when I went home Christmas 2009, I met a buddy of mine who I had become acquaintances with over Hacker News. My buddy's name is Thomas. He's a security consultant who works in Chicago.

He knows that I'm pretty good on this online marketing stuff that I've been blogging about for the last couple of years. Oh, if it wasn't obvious, I'd kept up a blog from the day I started working on Bingo Card Creator in 2006, through 2010 and continuing through now.

Justin: That's at kalzumeus.com.

Patrick: Right. Kalzumeus.com. It moved around a bit, but it's there now.

Justin: OK.

Patrick: Anyhow, so there's this guy in Hacker News who was very smart. We're mutual admiration society of each other's comments, and he was in Chicago where my family's from. I said, "Hey, I'm coming home for Christmas, do you want to get coffee?" My only plan for getting coffee was, why don't we talk about Hacker News threads and laugh? I'm a geek. I'm very, very geeky.

Thomas says, "That sounds like an excellent plan." We go to a coffee shop. He says, "Hey, this coffee shop happens to be under my office. Do you want to come up to my office?"

We go to his office. Says, "Hey, why don't we drink our coffee in that conference room over there with my VP?" Thomas, who founded the security consultancy with a few other guys and his VP come into the conference room and they lock the door at me. We just start talking about online marketing, and in particular, how I would do online marketing if I was in charge of it for a security consultancy.

This is absolute brain crack for me. I talk non-stop for about three hours. At the end of it, Thomas has a check list of things that he's going to try. He says, "I've got to tell you, as a consultant myself, if you hadn't phrased this as, 'Let's get coffee together...' If you had phrased this as, 'Why don't I do a consulting gig for you on improving your online marketing,' I would be writing you a check right now."

I had just quit a job that paid me less than $3000 a month. I thought that $100 an hour would be incredibly generous for intermediate engineer's time. My mental peg for my work was $100 an hour. I said, "Well, Thomas, $300 around Christmas, honestly that's not enough to worry about doing a whole invoicing dance or anything." Yada, yada, yada. I was basically coming up with reasons why I could not do the consulting that I had just done.

Thomas said, "I don't think this was worth $300. I think this was worth $15,000 to me." I said, "What?" Thomas went to his VP and he said, "Do you think we got $15,000 out of this?" The VP said, "$15,000 is a little steep." I said, "See, the VP, he is sane." The VP then stumbles over my words and says, "But we could pay $5000 for it out of petty cash, no problem." That was the first time I ever had the inkling that, wow, for-profit businesses really have money to spend on business problems.

Sure enough, they did actually deploy the advice to much more than either of those two numbers, in fact within several weeks. That ended up working out pretty well. Prior to that, people had emailed me a couple of times and said, "Hey, I read you blog. You seem like a smart guy. Do you consult?"

I always said, "No. I've got a day job." Yada, yada, yada, but when folks emailed me after I quit, instead of saying, "I don't think I'm good enough to do consulting," I started to say, "Yeah. That sounds found. Why don't we talk about it?"

With the idea that I could do that during the summer months and then not have to dip into savings or anything. I started doing consulting concurrently with the product development. Actually, I say that, but I had a good six months of down time caused by just total burnout. Because, for the last six months at the day job, I was working 100 hour weeks, seven days a week and it just killed me. There's another product story in here.

[cross-talk]

Justin: I'd love to hear the next one. Let's go.

Patrick: Sure. Basically, at no point in my life was I ever thinking, "Man, I should live off..." Oh, maybe not true.

[silence 36:45 to 36:53]

Patrick: Let me think. I was about to say, at no point in my life did I ever think that I would just live off Bingo Card Creator. That's not true. During the midst of my burnout, that was an attractive option to me.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: Just coast on Bingo Card Creator, spend five hours a week on maintenance, and then just spend the rest of my time living. Because I was very much overworked. The thing that changed my mind on that score was a conversation with Joel Spolsky, who I got my coffee entrepreneurship bud from his forums, and spent a lot of time reading his essays. He's one of my software heroes.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: I had the opportunity to meet him at a conference once. I don't know if the entire conversation is for public consumption, but the gist of it was that people who are capable of doing things have an obligation to do them...to bring their gifts to the world basically. He grounded it in a Talmudic understanding of the relationship between people, society, and capabilities and obligations, which...I'm not Jewish, I'm actually strict Catholic, but it spoke to me.

Justin: Interesting. Yeah.

Patrick: Wow. It would be a waste if that was all I did. Then I got more serious about shipping the second product that I'd been thinking of. Let's talk about the second products. That's a misnomer. There were three second products.

While I was still at the day job, I had made inklings of direction of launching two different things prior to that, but I had killed both of them before launch, because I did everything the LEAN startup folks tell you not to do.

Justin: OK.

Patrick: I started from, "I think this sounds like a great problem. I'm going to go code away in my bat cave for a little while, and then I'm going to try and find customers for it." Luckily, I didn't have them done, but they were half-built in the bat cave before I figured out, wait, there's no way I can make the numbers work for this, or of getting customers into it, and I have no clue what the customer even looks like.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: But anyhow. After quitting the day job, I was exposed to a technology called Twilio. Twilio is an API that lets you make phone calls and send text messages from a web application. This is not the right way to go about identifying a business. I thought, wow, that's an awesome capability, and there's so much done by businesses that requires a telephone. There must be some way I can make a business on top of this new tech that I love playing with.

Justin: Yeah. That happens a lot. I think people will see there's some tools or there's some technology, and you'll be thinking, man, how can I build a business around that? I think that's a really...

Patrick: It's seductive, and it's the wrong way to think of it.

Justin: Yeah, exactly.

Patrick: The problem was, that's the way I actually did it. Do what I say, not what I do. I had a notebook full of ideas for what I could do for Twilio. Then one day, in the midst of my being burnt out and getting up at noon and feeling like doing not too much, I went down to the cafe where I usually had lunch.

Went to the massage therapist next door and said, "I spend too much time on the computer. My shoulders are aching. Can you give me a massage?" She said, "Yeah, we have a two-hour wait right now, but we can see you after two hours." I said, "Oh, that's fine. I've got an iPad with me. I'll just sit in this chair and wait here for two hours."

15 minutes later, she comes back and says, "I know I told you two hours later, but it would be really, really good if you could take your massage right now." I said, "Oh. Sure, that's no problem for me. I have nothing planned today, because I'm gainfully unemployed. But can I ask, what changed?"

She said, "Well, my appointment that was scheduled to come in right now didn't come in." I'm like, "Oh, that's interesting." One of the things that had been in my book of ideas was reminding software.

I said, "Why didn't you call him to see if he was coming in to the appointment?" She said something that stuck with me. "I'm a massage therapist. If my hands are on the telephone, they're not on someone's back. If they're not on someone's back, I'm not getting paid," I said, "Ooh. Ooh, that's interesting."

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: The next time I went back to America to see family...Again in Chicago...I went to an ATM, took out $400, and started wandering around downtown Chicago just looking for anything that looked like a high-end salon or a massage therapy practice or that sort of thing. I would walk into them, talk to the lady behind the counter, and say, "Excuse me, are you the proprietor?" If she said yes, I said, "Do you accept walk-ins?"

If she said yes, I said, "All right. I'd like the 30-minute thing. But I have a proposition for you. Rather than having a massage or a haircut for the next 30 minutes, I just want to talk to you about the industry, because I'm interested in it. I'll pay you your normal rate."

Justin: I love this idea. Did it work?

Patrick: It worked out so well. I think only one person actually took money for it. All the rest were happy just to talk to somebody who would listen. I said, "What do you do for scheduling? How many appointments do you see in a day?" People were telling me... The vast majority of them did scheduling on pencil and paper, or catch as catch can. They had a lot of appointments, relative to walk-ins.

They had severe no-show problems. Some of them would do appointment reminder phone calls themselves. Some of them meant to, but too many things going on in the business, never got around to doing them.

Some of them have an office manager that was supposed to do that, but because the people who are office managers at salons tend to not be the most diligent people in the world, it was haphazard. There was a huge amount of problem for it. I'm like, "Appointment Reminder. Totally going forward."

I released an MVP of it, which was just one page that showed, basically, that if you gave me your telephone number, I could...Actually, I think I'm getting my timeline wrong. I did the MVP first. Made a page that, if you gave me a telephone number, I would give you a phone call immediately. Had this voice actress, who was a college student that I hired on Fiverr, for $10, recorded basically a sales pitch for Appointment Reminder.

That said, "If you can come to your fake appointment, which is five minutes from now, please press one." Then, as soon as you pressed one, it would flash on your computer screen that you just confirmed their appointment. If they had cancelled the appointment, we could SMS you right now, so that you could reschedule someone and save that one. I showed that on my iPad to people, and asked them, during the conversation in Chicago.

I said, "Would you buy this?" Five people said yes. They were totally in at that price point. I was pitching at like $30 a month. "OK. There exists a market for this."

Justin: Five people out of how many?

Patrick: Good question. I talked to about a dozen people that day. I don't know if I actually got to the sales pitch on everybody. But I think it's less a question of five people out of how many...It's more a question of, can you even find five people in the world who will buy it?

If you can find five people, there's probably more than five people. The world is a big place. If you can't find five people, on the other hand, when you're talking to them and you've got that little crazy founder glow in your eye that people want to say "yes," just to get you out of this door.

If you can't sell someone with that, you're not going to be able to sell them with a web page. Might as well not build that. That's my take on the LEAN startup methodology for very bootstrapped startups.

Justin: Yeah. I like that, because there is...You have this theory of different ways to do customer development and LEAN. But then there's the actual practice. I'm always interested. In actual practice, what do people find? You're saying, if you can find five people that say they'll buy, the world is a big place and there's probably more people that will buy?

Patrick: Yeah. Exactly. Interestingly, I think the customer development led me a little stray, in one respect...My conception, from the time I started the project...Because I was talking to people in massage therapy practices and salons and that sort of thing, was that, an appointment is something that you, the client, go to. There is another whole market of service providers, where the service provider comes to you for the appointment.

For things like exterminators, the trades, HVAC installers, yada, yada. It turns out that they have a much more pressing need to avoid no-shows than massage therapy practice has. Because if a massage therapy practice gets someone...They flake out. Yeah, they lose revenue, but it's only about $60 of revenue and maybe they can slot in a walk-in. But if you have an HVAC company that has three guys who go out in a van to someone's house and they get locked out...

A, the company is out $200 for that truck roll. Meaning, putting the people in the van and sending them out. But B, they probably just lost out on a $2000 furnace repair job that might get done by one of the their competitors now, because people don't typically leave broken furnaces for a day.

Justin: How did you figure that out? How did you discover that need in that market?

Patrick: An exterminator or something related to that found me for just Googling for "appointment reminder." They signed up for the service. The business names was like Bob's Termite B Gone, or whatever. I thought, "Interesting, that's an exterminator would use this." It's a service that...Communication is the point of the service. It's sending SMS messages between you and your customers...Yada, yada. Obviously, "I know this guy's contact information. He gave an email address to sign up."

I said, "Hey, Bob," of Bob's Termite B Gone, "want to talk about appointments for a little while? I think I have some ideas for you." I gave him some ideas on better messaging he could use about cancellations. In return, I said, "Why does a Termite B Gone place need a appointment reminding software?" He laid out the, "Well, three guys in a van burn $200 every time they go out to a site whether I get paid or not." Like, "Oh, that's interesting." That helped me change the marketing message a little bit.

Justin: Is that a primary market you're going after now?

Patrick: That sort of thing, where the customer doesn't go the appointment, the appointment comes to the customer is probably...If you ball them up together, it's a bunch of industries. But that's probably my second largest customer group, after probably medical. Medical wasn't even scoped for version 1.0 of Appointment Reminder. Because there's this Health Information Privacy and Portability Act, I think. It's an American law about health information security standards that...

There was some technical and legal groundwork that I had to lay before I could say that I could support health care providers. But it turns out that...I won't bore your listeners with the whole story about this, because it's much more interesting for my business than for their businesses. But it turns out that there's various hacks around that. I'm in a...Well, the less said about that the better.

Justin: [laughs]

Patrick: Suffice to say, there are hospitals on Appointment Reminder right now. As a matter of fact, I think eight of the ten largest US hospitals are on Appointment Reminder. Sadly, not for all of their appointment needs, but...

Justin: Yeah. When did you launch Appointment Reminder?

Patrick: The MVP I created in maybe May of 2010, the month after quitting the day job. I launched it in December of 2010. It's been going on for just a little over two years now.

Justin: OK, in terms of your whole world of revenue, what portion of that does it represent?

Patrick: OK. We didn't mention it in the interview, so just back-tracking a little bit. I've been very transparent with many parts of my business for the last couple of years. Bingo Card Creator, for example, has a page that you can go to that will literally say what my sales are for every month for the last six years. But I'm perpetually "Will I? Won't I?" on taking investment for Appointment Reminder.

That makes it difficult for me to disclose numbers. Not in that investors will hate me if I don't disclose numbers, because it's the opposite. Most companies don't. But, basically, if I disclose numbers then they can see the numbers without having to talk to me.

If I don't disclose numbers then to get an insight into the business they have to talk to me. If they come out of the woodwork and talk to me, I basically get implicit permission to pitch them, should I ever decide to take investment for it.

I'm going to avoid saying how big Appointment Reminder is, in relation to my other businesses. Can I just mention...If you're wondering, extrapolate a little bit from the fact that it's used in eight of the top ten US hospitals.

Justin: Yeah. The market seems big. One thing I'm thinking, as I'm talking to, is the markets you've gone into...Teachers, massage therapists...There's a lot of folks that try to launch products for those groups. Not a lot of people think about launching products for exterminators.

Do you think that it's still worthwhile launching a product, for example, for teachers? Or for massage therapists? Or do you think that product people need to be going after these other markets that they might not have thought about?

Patrick: Appointment Reminder is a broad horizontal product, which happens to target, in the marketing, individual verticals, like massage therapy and whatnot. But it was never a product built by massage therapists, for massage therapists. With specific regards to elementary and high school educators, for your listeners who might be thinking of getting into building a product business. I'm going to recommend that you don't go after teachers.

Especially if you do, well, pretty much for any reason. I love teachers, I love education. I worked six years in this field. The amount of pain you go through for, like, increment of success you get is off the charts compared to working in B2B, business to business.

Businesses have a lot more money. The people who are responsible for making a purchasing decision in the business aren't spending their own money to buy your thing, where teachers typically are spending their own money to buy your thing. Teachers are very reluctant to spend 30 dollars of their own money where the office manager at a business is very not reluctant to spend 200 dollars a month of that business' money.

The top line plan for Appointment Reminder that's actually exposed on the website is $200, so that's $2,400 a year in revenue. That's about 100 bingo card sales, like a month of sales in some months, that I can get from one person who just comes to the website and signs up five minutes later, and never calls me. That doesn't even crater the approach to the bridge to the high-touch enterprise sales, where I'm talking to a hospital individually about, "Well, quote us a price if we have 10,000 patients a month."

I would recommend avoid the education market. I would tend to avoid hobbyist markets for the same reason, especially hobbyist markets with lots of overlaps with geeks, because they typically are way, way over-served. For example, again, I'm a geek. I own it. I play dungeons and dragons.

You also play dungeons and dragons, and you're thinking, "Man, there's something that can be done with a computer that hasn't been done yet for dungeons and dragons," A, I think you're probably wrong, but B, that is not a great use of your time from a financial returns perspective. Make something for boring businesses, or other underserved markets that are valuable.

One I talk about a lot is making products for women, because if you've been around a developer conference ever, you've noticed the switch in the community. People largely make things to scratch their own itches, and there being less women around who have capability of making software products, less that their itches get scratched. Some of them are, for example, in jobs that are largely female dominated, like, say, nursing and whatnot, or office managing.

There's compelling business problems that can be solved by not too difficult software, which can be worth substantial amounts of money.

Justin: Yeah. Yeah. You've talked about how you your initial taking the MVP for appointment reminder around in Chicago. What would you, so if you're just, because a lot of product people, like, people that are interested in building products. Sometimes we are people that are sitting in an office all day, or we have a life, or we might, the things we interact with, our kids go to school, so we think about teachers, we go to the massage therapists, and we go to get our hair cut, all these things.

We're often thinking about those kinds of problems, or we're thinking about our own problems. Do you have any hacks for ways you've gotten to know some problems from people in boring businesses, as you've said?

Patrick: I think being relentlessly curious and talking to people about their business problems helps on that. I have no...I consume services from, say, massage therapy practices, but I also consume pizza, that doesn't exactly make me a pizza chef or a massage therapist, but I love talking to folks for any reason.

I keep an ear open, talk to folks. People love talking about their problems. A sympathetic ear is one of the most motivational things that you can offer somebody...to just say, "Hey. You're a nurse. What's sucks about being a nurse?"

About 15 minutes talking to someone while you're waiting for your kid to get out of the doctor's appointment, or "Say, you run reception at a dental clinic? What software do you use? Do you like it?"

The answer's going to be no. "Why don't you like it? I'm just curious about your industry. Who in the company makes decisions about purchasing things?" Yadda, yadda, yadda. But just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. You've got friends. They're probably in diverse walks of life. Talk to them about things.

My father's a real estate developer. I've been hearing his real estate development stories for the last 30 years of my life. Talk to him about, "Hey Dad. What do you do manually still in your business?" They do a heck of a lot of the data gathering that they do to source deals is, it revolves around paper maps and Googling things randomly.

There must be some way to automate that process. It would probably be worth...my father works in commercial real estate. The basically smallest deal that his company could go after is in the millions of dollars. Think of how much increasing the effectiveness of him at sourcing deals by 10 percent would be worth for that company.

Justin: Yeah. Is that the math you do? Because on one hand, you can go find a business problem, but is that the math you do when you're trying to figure out, how much could they potentially pay or how much would this be worth to them?

Patrick: Right. There's two things you can offer to any business to induce them to get into a business relationship with you, whether that's buying a product or consuming your consulting services or employing you. The first is to increase their revenue, and the second is to decrease costs. Of the two of them, increasing revenue is generally more motivational from a businessman's perspective.

I would generally tend to look for high-visibility problems that are close to the money, as opposed to "You can do inventory tracking software, which is going to save you five dollars on your next toilet paper purchase." This is probably not enough to get them to change the way that they do business.

Every business already has ossified ways that they do business right now. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to convince them to go from their current process into using your software that they've never heard of before. You have to have a really compelling advantage over what they're doing right now.

Shaving off a buck here or a buck there is not a really compelling advantage, but plus 10 percent improvement on the effectiveness of employees that cost four or five figures a month...We make your software developers who cost $20,000 a month fully loaded, we make then 10 percent more effective. That's $2000 per developer, and you might have 30 of them, you're willing to pay a lot of money for that, and that's why a lot of software that targets software developers is all done in per seat basis by the way.

Justin: Interesting.

Patrick: Similarly, if you were thinking who in the organization to make software for. Minimum wage employees on the ground floor? Probably not as good as the folks who, A they have the authority to buy things, and B they're a bit higher in the organization, higher salaries and what not in imputed cost to their time. That's not a law of nature, it's just a rule of thumb.

Justin: I think that's a really important point. Sometimes you just identify a problem and the problem is painful...you just really want o solve this thing that's painful, but if you're going to make a business out of it, there has to be someone who's going to be willing to pay you for that. Then you have to subtract some other things.

You have to subtract your time, but also how much time and effort is it going to take to support this thing. We don't always do that math, sometimes the problem is so painful that we don't thing about how much are people willing to pay for this, and how much time would it take to support it.

Patrick: One thing that people don't appreciate enough is that there's different types of pain. One for example is pain that people know they have versus pain that people experience, but don't know that they have. There's a pain that has people searching for solutions actively, and the kind that people figure is just a cost of doing business.

You want to be solving a problem that people know they have the problem and are actively looking for solutions, rather than something that the pain is bearable, or is just considered so endemic to the condition that they are not actively trying to get better at that.

For example, among people who could buy Appointment Reminder, they have the word no show. It's a hair on fire problem for them. When I mention would you be interested if I could get rid of all your no shows or a substantial percentage of your no shows, their eyes just light up, and they actively search on Google for it.

By comparison, let's us an example from education, grade book software, it sucks. Most teachers do not wake up in the morning and say, "My grade-book software sucks." Many things about teaching suck. Grade-books are one of them. Every teacher puts up with it. I know a few people who've made grade-book software and that doesn't typically work out great for them.

Justin: This is another thing that I think is challenging. When you finally identify a pain...and you go, "This is a real pain," like it's definitely a pain, but when you start talking to people, like you've said, it's not a hair on fire issue. Even if they have the problem, why is it so hard to convince people when it's not something that they're actively searching for an answer for?

Patrick: Mind if I turn that question around a little bit? I think as developers, and as product people...We have the ability to create things, which is magical. We get a little high on our own supply sometimes, such that, "I am capable of creating this software, ergo it's going to have these awesome features, and ergo that's going to be awesome and change people's lives forever, such that they will not remember their life prior to using it."

We can stand to learn a little bit of humility and meet users where they actually are. To a certain point of view, I think that..."Why is it hard to convince people that they're in pain from these antiquated solutions that they're using that are clearly sub optimal...maybe they're not?"

Maybe we should have the humility to talk to them and to actually figure out what they genuinely want, what they think that they need and meet them there. Users, they'll make things as not most users core options. They often won't understand what's capable or what's possible like we do. Maybe they can articulate their pain but they wouldn't necessarily come to a great solution without guidance from us.

But we should definitely listen to them and be actively engaged in them in the process of creating ideas in order to make their lives better. Because ultimately, it's their life that has to get better or the product is a failure.

Justin: Mm-hmm, and I think, maybe in response to that, some people would say, "Well does that mean we're just always going to go after this low hanging fruit?" In a business, there's the things that are like hair on fire issues that you need to deal with all the time. They're a real pain and they're making your boss stressed out.

But then there's these deeper underlying issues that maybe there's not a lot of Google searches for those or whatever. Those are important. We need to deal with those underlying important issues that are not just on the surface, but deeper.

How should we respond to that? When we're building software are we always going to be just building for hair on fire issues?

Patrick: Well, it would be awesome if we could build software which would solve every educational problem in the United States. But given that most of us are makers doing this on the side, we have limited resources. We have to have an appreciation for what is reasonably possible and that's going to largely council going after things that are low hanging fruit.

Even for folks who are on the funded start up track, so they can afford to work without revenue for a couple of years on a project and try to blow up, they typically go after problems that...like, they're problems. People genuinely feel them. But they're not the problem that gets written about in a sociology book, to put it mildly.

That's partially a pragmatic answer. But in addition to it being a pragmatic answer I think there's honestly a lot of good that can be done by just solving people's pressing problems that come up all the time. Simply because if we keep knocking down all the problems that come up all the time and exposing each layer of increasingly higher fruit after the first one, then their lives are getting better all the time.

Software doesn't do one one-hundredth of a percent of what it possibly could do for most people. You can tell because most people's only use for software is email and Facebook at the moment. Even with that, email revolutionized how almost every knowledge worker worked.

Obviously you're not going to create email but you probably will create the next version of email or the next version of Facebook. Each incremental improvement that genuinely helps people out, genuinely helps people out. The scale that you can achieve with incremental improvements when delivered over the Internet, if you understand the marketing side of things too, is just absolutely incredible.

I think I did the math once. I've probably taught over two million kids a reading lesson with Bingo Card Creator which, if I was a teacher working in a school teaching 30 kids at once, I don't think I could teach two million student lessons in an entire career. But I'm able to do that while sleeping thanks to Bingo Card Creator scaling so well...

Justin: Yeah

Patrick: ...and it doesn't scale so well unlike the Facebook [indecipherable 68:33] version. It's just a website can work when I'm not in. If you can...Obviously Bingo Card Creator is one of the most trivial apps I could possibly think of. That's partially why I picked it. If I'd known then what I know now, I probably would have gone with something a bit larger in scope for my first business, not 10 orders of magnitude larger in scope.

Justin: I think we're going to wind down pretty quick here, but I'd like to ask maybe a couple of more questions. Then, if you have anything else you'd like to share before you go. I think one thing that we didn't touch on here that would be interesting to cover maybe in the future is knowledge products. There's software products and sometimes it'd be interesting exploring that. But maybe we could do that another time.

Patrick: Yeah. I think that is a deep topic which I've gotten interested in recently. We could definitely talk for an hour on that one too. Why don't we table that for maybe next time?

Justin: Sure. Let's close with this. I live in Canada, so for me this is not as big of an issue. But for people that live in other parts of the world, how important is the American market right now for building software products?

If you are in Asia or Europe or Africa or somewhere else, would you still build a product for the American market? Or would you look at your local market? Or would you look at maybe...Maybe there's markets I'm not even aware of. Like maybe Europe is doing really well right now. Internationally, what do you think is a good starting place for people building products?

Patrick: This is a question near and dear to my heart considering I'm in Japan. I'll tell you all my products target primarily American companies or American customers. One of the reasons for that is that while my Japanese is pretty good my ability to write marketing copy in Japanese is not that great. Largely I'm selling to the people who I know how to sell to.

Another reason is that there's significant differences in how the software adoption cycle works at Japanese companies versus American companies. I won't give you the entire list of how Japanese companies are such [indecipherable 71:04] pathological, and how they do decision making, but suffice it to say that they don't really sign up for software as a service with their credit card after reading a website which is critical to me.

I end up selling to American companies. But partly that's because I am a foreigner living in Japan. If I was a Japanese person I would probably sell to Japanese companies instead. While it's true that America is the largest software market and is a few years ahead of the game with regards to getting on new innovations like say the software as a service model.

American companies spend a lot more on software as a service product [indecipherable 71:45] absolute basis on a per company basis than companies in other countries do. In say Japan, it's not really a...it's getting there but it isn't really a well understood thing yet. Anyhow, even with that being the case, targeting your local market has a lot to recommend it.

Just like you don't go into an overfished pond like D&amp;D gamers, the U.S. is an overfished pond relative to...well, a heavily fished pond relative to any other country in the world. There's a lot of software that does...say, accounting and whatnot, that just won't work for an office in, say, Canada, because it's built around American accounting standards and the way American customers expect things to work, and not for how Canadian folks expect things to work.

Similarly, a lot of ideas that would be, "Oh my God, a invoicing app? We've got like a hundred of them," in Japan, there's only one invoicing app worth talking about. It's called MakeLeaps. A friend of mine runs it. It's a ridiculously mature market in the United States, and FreshBooks has sewn it up, and then there's other competitors, but in Japan, it's wide open, and the conversation is less, "Do you use FreshBooks, or do you use one of the competitors?"

But it's, "Are we ever going to use software for invoicing?" Even with a software that might not be as mature as FreshBooks is, software has a lot to recommend over pencil and paper, which is the primary competitor for MakeLeaps, so MakeLeaps is doing really, really well.

Justin: Interesting. If you're in one of those markets that's not the States, you might, say, consider maybe offering something that's not being offered yet. What about...

Patrick: I think there's absolutely no shame in taking something that works in the American market and bringing a version to your market, for example. OK, don't copy Bingo Card Creator, and I'm not saying that because I don't want the competition. I'm just saying because it's not a great, wonderful use of your time.

Hypothetically, if you're an Australian, the way that Bingo works is different in Australia than is in the United States, and most Australians can't use my Bingo Card Creator. You could hypothetically make Bingo Card Creator, because you know Bingo Card Creator, as a business works, from seeing it work for me, ergo, it should probably work in Australia.

Again, don't do it, but that's an example, where if you see a FreshBooks working in America, then FreshBooks probably should work in Japan, too, if someone would just go to the...Invoicing software should work in Japan, and if you see...What's that German company that their shtick is, they take American startups and clone them for Germany, and eventually get acquired?

A lot of people wag their fingers at them and say, "That's not innovative," but given that American companies don't typically launch to the entire world at the same, I think that does accelerate the adoption process of that technology by the German audience, and other than an irrational preference for innovative business models, I don't see how that's bad in any way.

Justin: That's right.

Patrick: Don't be afraid to use an idea that has been done before, even if it's been done in your market too. I'm certainly not the first Bingo Card Creator software that came out. Probably the only one that's actually good but there you go.

Justin: [laughs] Yeah. Well thanks so much for your time Patrick. I really [laughs] enjoyed the conversation. Glad we could make it happen.

Patrick: Yeah. I am too. Hopefully it was useful for some of your listeners.

Justin: Yeah. I like how we were really able to get a lot of your back story in the first part of our conversation. I felt like the second half has a lot of just really practical tips that people could walk away with. Both are important that we get the context and the story, we get to know the person but then we can also walk away with some practical things to apply. Is there anything else that you want to say quickly or leave us with, before we go?

Patrick: Sure. Well, I may as well give people some links to take a look at. My blog is at Kalzumeus.com/blog. We'll link that up in the comments to the interview.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: I have a email list that you can get on at training.kalzumeus.com. I send out an email every week or two about software and software marketing topics. This is my business but it's also my hobby. I really love talking about software and I can basically have unlimited propensity to do so. If you ever want to talk about it, drop me an email. My email address is patrick@kalzumeus.com.

Justin: Perfect. Well I've certainly enjoyed talking to you. I'm going to have to have you back on the show again sometime in the future. Maybe we can talk about information products next time.

Patrick: Sure. I would love to do that. Thanks very much Justin. It was an honor to be invited.</pre>

		<itunes:summary>Want to build a software product that actually earns income?

In this (Part 2) episode Patrick McKenzie (Patio11) shares specific tactics for researching a market and finding a problem to solve. &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.strongcaster.com/productpeople/ep006-productpeople.mp3&quot;&gt;Listen now&lt;/a&gt;.
Highlights

	Don&#039;t think up a cool product idea, go and spend months developing it, and then try to find customers. It won&#039;t work.
	Instead, go out and talk to people and see if you can find 5 people who will buy it.
	Trick for interviewing people in potential markets: tell them you&#039;ll pay them their normal rate, but instead of getting their service, you get to ask them questions about their industry (Patio11 interviewed massage therapists and stylists this way)
	Be relentlessly curious: ask people about their business problems.
	&quot;Businesses have a lot more money. The people who are responsible for making a purchasing decision in the business aren&#039;t spending their own money; the office manager at a business is very not reluctant to spend 200 dollars a month of that business&#039; money.&quot;
	Avoid the education and hobbyist markets: Patrick loves Dungeons and Dragons, but doesn&#039;t think you can make much income by building software products for D&amp;D players.
	&quot;There&#039;s different types of pain: you want to be solving a problem where people know they have the problem and are actively looking for solutions, rather than something that the pain is bearable, or is just considered so endemic to the condition that they are not actively trying to get better at that.&quot;
	Have the humility to talk to people and find out what they really want.

Justin: Huh. That is so fascinating. Basically, in 2010, you were able to stop working at the day job and just live on product income.

Patrick: Right.

Justin: Was there a portion of that that was consulting, as well, or was that all, you quit because you were making enough on the product?

Patrick: I quit because I was making enough on the product. But there&#039;s an asterisk there with regards to consulting stuff. Bingo Card Creator is highly seasonal, because it tracks the school year. Sales go down every summer. I was quitting in April.

I thought, OK, I know I&#039;m fine until the school year ends. Then, summer&#039;s going to be interesting. Either I&#039;m going to be burning savings or having to subsist on credit cards until the school year starts up again.

Justin: Yeah.

Patrick: But when I went home Christmas 2009, I met a buddy of mine who I had become acquaintances with over Hacker News. My buddy&#039;s name is Thomas. He&#039;s a security consultant who works in Chicago.

He knows that I&#039;m pretty good on this online marketing stuff that I&#039;ve been blogging about for the last couple of years. Oh, if it wasn&#039;t obvious, I&#039;d kept up a blog from the day I started working on Bingo Card Creator in 2006, through 2010 and continuing through now.

Justin: That&#039;s at kalzumeus.com.

Patrick: Right. Kalzumeus.com. It moved around a bit, but it&#039;s there now.

Justin: OK.

Patrick: Anyhow, so there&#039;s this guy in Hacker News who was very smart. We&#039;re mutual admiration society of each other&#039;s comments, and he was in Chicago where my family&#039;s from. I said, &quot;Hey, I&#039;m coming home for Christmas, do you want to get coffee?&quot; My only plan for getting coffee was, why don&#039;t we talk about Hacker News threads and laugh? I&#039;m a geek. I&#039;m very, very geeky.

Thomas says, &quot;That sounds like an excellent plan.&quot; We go to a coffee shop. He says, &quot;Hey,</itunes:summary>
