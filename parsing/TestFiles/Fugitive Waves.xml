In this episode we move from the pink plush studio in the Holiday Inn, with undies hanging on clotheslines in the lobby,  into the 1960s and a new studio in the Mid-City building, Memphis. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, the women&#8217;s movement, Vietnam, and the death of Martin Luther King—the story of WHER continues following the women who pioneered in broadcasting as they head into one of the most dramatic and volatile times in the nation&#8217;s history. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Sam Phillips sold Elvis&#8217; contract in 1955 he used the money to start an all girl radio station in Memphis, TN. Set in a pink, plush studio in the nations&#8217; third Holiday Inn, it was a novelty—but not for long. He hired models, beauty queens, actresses, telephone operators. Some were young mothers who just needed a job. WHER was the first radio station to feature women as more than novelties and sidekicks. The WHER girls were broadcasting pioneers. From 1955 into the mid-1970s they ruled the airwaves with style, wit and imagination. &#8220;WHER was the embryo of the egg,&#8221; said Sam Phillips. &#8220;We broke a barrier. There was nothing like it in the world.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 1993: A small village in Sicily prepares for the first visit of 78-year-old baseball legend Joe DiMaggio to the town where his parents were born and raised. Fishermen, artisans, grandmothers &#8212; some 3,000 villagers brush up on The Yankee and Marilyn Monroe. Italian and American flags are strung from the buildings, two thousand baseballs are purchased for Joltin&#8217; Joe to autograph. A feast of sea urchins, calamari, pasta sarda and marzipan is cooked in his honor. Nearly the entire annual budget of the town is spent preparing to celebrate the homecoming of the Yankee Clipper. The Mayor, the City Council, the Police Commissioner and hundreds of other Sicilian well wishers gather at the airport in Palermo waiting to greet their &#8220;native son&#8221;. But he never comes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As construction commenced in 1968 on the largest building project since the pyramids, questions and controversies swirled around Lower Manhattan. How tall? Why two? What&#8217;s a slurry wall? A kangaroo crane? Where are the small businesses going to go? What&#8217;s a world trade center and who needs it anyway? Guy Tozzoli, the Port Authority visionary behind the building of the Twin Towers, had an inspiration—&#8221;Construction Guides.&#8221; Friendly co-eds in mini-skirt uniforms were posted at corner kiosks on the site to inform an inquiring public and put a pretty face on a controversial issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert King Wilkerson was imprisoned at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana for 31 years. Twenty-nine of those years he was in solitary confinement. During that time he created a clandestine kitchen in his 6&#215;9 cell where he made pralines, heating the the butter and sugar he saved from his food tray over a tiny burner concocted from a Coke can and a toilet paper roll. King and two of his friends started a chapter of the Black Panthers in Angola Prison during the 1970s. King&#8217;s case was overturned in 2001 and he was released. He lectures around the world and makes candy &#8212; which he called Freelines &#8212; to bring attention to issues of prison reform and the plight of The Angola Three. King was living in New Orleans during Katrina, refused to leave his dog, and weathered the storm in his apartment. Two weeks in, his friends from Austin bought a boat and went in to get him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone in San Quentin calls him Wall Street. Curtis Carroll aka Wall Street teaches his fellow prisoners about stocks. Through friends and family on the outside, he invests and he&#8217;s also an informal financial adviser to fellow inmates and correctional officers.</p>
<p>When Wall Street was put in prison almost two decades ago he couldn&#8217;t read or write. One day he stumbled on the financial section of the newspaper thinking it was the sports section, which his cellie used to read to him. An inmate asked him if he played the stocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never heard the word before,&#8221; says Wall Street. &#8220;He explained to me how it works and said, &#8216;This is where white people keep their money.&#8217; When he said that I said, &#8216;Whoa, I think I stumbled across something here.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Wall Street taught himself how to read and write beginning with candy wrappers and clothing logos. Today he pores over financial news: the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, <em>Forbes</em>. Business is like a soap opera, he says, and he&#8217;s always trying to anticipate what will happen next. &#8220;I like to know what the CEO&#8217;s doing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I like to know who&#8217;s in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wall Street doesn&#8217;t have access to a computer or the Internet, so he calls his family members to check the closing prices for the day, and he tells them what to buy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in prison, but I&#8217;m on just the same playing field as Warren Buffett,&#8221; Carroll says. &#8220;I can pick the exact same companies. I can&#8217;t buy as many shares, but technically we&#8217;re just the same.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Braveheart Women&#8217;s Society, a group of Yankton Sioux grandmothers and tribal elders, have re-established an almost forgotten coming of age ritual for young girls—the Isnati, a four day traditional ceremony on the banks of the Missouri River in South Dakota. The girls learn to set up their own teepee, collect traditional herbs and flowers used for remedies. They are not allowed to touch food or feed themselves for four days; they are fed and given water by their mother or other women  at the ceremony. They are being treated as babies for the last time in their lives. One of the grandmothers makes each girl a special dress. On the last day of the ceremony, the girls, one at a time, go into the teepee with their mother or their auntie who bathes them and dresses them and does their hair. The elder tells the girl stories about what she was like as a baby, how beautiful she is and about the hopes and promises for her future.The girls prepare sacred ceremonial food and feed their community. She&#8217;s given a new name and is presented to the the community as a woman.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Steinbeck called it the &#8220;Mother Road.&#8221; Songwriter Bobby Troup described it as the route to get your kicks on. And Mickey Mantle said, &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for Highway 66 I never would have been a Yankee.&#8221; For the Dust Bowl refugees of the 1930s, for the thousands who migrated after World War II, and for the generations of tourists and vacationers, Route 66 was &#8220;the Way West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Route 66, the first continuous paved highway linking east and west was the most traveled and well known road in America for almost fifty years. From Chicago, it ran through the Ozarks of Missouri, across Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, up the mesas of New Mexico and Arizona, and down into California to the Pacific Ocean. The First road of it&#8217;s kind, it came to represent America&#8217;s mobility and freedom —inspiring countless stories, songs, and even a TV show.</p>
<p>In part II of Route 66, Studs Terkel reads from &#8220;The Grapes of Wrath&#8221; and comments on the great 1930s migration along Highway 66. We hear from black and white musicians including Clarence Love, head of Clarence Love and his Orchestra—Woodie Guthrie—and Eldin Shamblin, guitar player for Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys— who remember life on the road for musicians during the 1930s. We travel the history of the road from its beginnings as &#8220;The Main Street of America,&#8221; through the &#8220;Road of Flight&#8221; in the 1930s, to the &#8220;Ghost Road&#8221; of the 1980s, as the interstates bypass the businesses and road side attractions of another era.</p>
<p>Produced by The Kitchen Sisters and narrated by actor David Selby.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worlds of a young Canadian immigrant, an Italian pasta-making family, and a 70-year-old survivor of the Armenian Genocide converge in this story of the San Francisco Treat.</p>
<p class="p1">A Canadian women (Lois DeDomenico) marries an Italian immigrant (Thomas DeDomenico) whose family started Golden Grain Macaroni in San Francisco. Just after WWII the newlyweds rent a room from an old Armenian woman (Pailadzo Captanian) who teaches the young pregnant 18 year old woman how to cook.  Yogurt, baklava, pilaf… After about 4 months the young couple move into their own place. A few years later, Lois&#8217; brother-in-law is eating over at her house— looks down at the pilaf on his plate and pronounces: “This would be good in a box.” Prepared and packaged foods are just beginning to come on strong. They name it Rice A Roni.</p>
<p class="p1">During those hours in the kitchen the old Armenian woman cooks and tells the younger women the story of her life — her forced trek from Turkey to Syria, leaving her two young sons with a Greek Family, her husband&#8217;s murder, the birth of her baby along the way (his name means child of pain), the story of the genocide. Mrs. Captanian shows Lois a book she wrote in 1919, directly after her experiences—one of the only eye-witness accounts written at the time. Most were published 30-40 years later by survivors. This one was published in 1919 for the Paris Peace Talks in hopes that it would help provide context for the establishment of an Armenian state.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie McCoy owned a janitorial service in Oxford, North Carolina, a tobacco town of some 10,000 people. When he was badly injured in a car wreck, frustrated and unable to work, a doctor told him &#8220;Try using your head instead of your hands.&#8221; Eddie took his passion for local history and a scavenged cassette recorder from a trash can and began taping his town. Eddie records the who, what, when, where and why of slavery times, sharecropping, the civil rights era, and of who poured the first concrete in Oxford.</p>

Nearly every song Edith Piaf sang came from a moment of her life on the streets of Paris.  She would tell her composer and musician lovers a story, or describe a feeling or show them a gesture and they would put music and words to her pain and passion, giving her back her own musical autobiography.  Charles Aznavour, Francis Lai, Georges Moustaki, Henri Contet, some of France's great musicians and writers recall their nights with Edith Piaf.

		<description><![CDATA[Narrated by Andy Garcia, the story of the men who read to the cigar rollers as they worked in the cigar factories of Ybor City and Tampa in the early 19th century.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated by Andy Garcia. At the turn of the century until the 1930s in the cigar factories of Tampa and Ybor City, a well dressed man in a panama hat with a loud and beautiful voice sat atop a platform and read to the cigar workers as they rolled. These readers, known as Lectores de Tabaqueres, read Cervantes, Zola, Victor Hugo, Karl Marx, Jules Verne&#8230; It was the voices and words of these lectores &#8211; before radio and mechanization, who informed, organized, and incited the cigar workers, who labored by hand until the 1930s, when both the rollers and readers were replaced by mechanization. A lost tradition of story and smoke.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Just about anytime we walk out of The Kitchen Sisters office in San Francisco we stop and stare in the windows of City Lights bookstore, soaking in the covers of the new arrivals.  Awhile back, we were stopped in our tracks by a book of photographs of Patti Smith – Patti staring down the camera, holding a movie camera herself.  It turns out Patti wasn't just the muse of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the Sixties, she was also muse and model for Judy Linn, an art student and budding photographer in New York.  

Paging through Patti Smith 1969-1976, we discovered Judy had that no only photographed Patti, she had made a little super-8 movies too, as the two young women created a world together. The movies were missing, but the soundtracks remained.  Lost and found sound, we thought.  Got to hear those recordings, got to meet that photographer.  And we did.  Fugitive Waves, Episode Number 7:  Just Girls: The Hidden World of Patti Smith and Judy Linn.

		<itunes:summary>In this episode of Fugitive Waves, The Kitchen Sisters ride the nightshift with The Homobile. Homobiles is a non-commercial, volunteer, 24/7 ride service created by Lynnee Breedlove for the "LGBTQRXT and transgender community and others around San Francisco who feel the need safe, dependable rides, outside traditional services.  "Moes getting hoes where they needs to goes," is their motto.   Homobiles is for people who feel at risk because they don't conform to sexual or gender norms and have been targets of rudeness or shame or violence, says Lynne.  Homobiles is a network of independent drivers who pilot their own cars, a non-profit organization that caters to this underserved, and sometimes harassed community in the Bay Area.  This community car service operates on donations.  No one is turned away for lack of funds.  Homobiles has been called "Uber for Drag Queens," but with a mission that is social, not financial.</itunes:summary>

		<description><![CDATA["I left Vietnam in 1972. I listen the radio when I was in high school. I still in Vietnam at that time. I left with US troops during the Vietnam War. I really love the song, you know, played by Glen Campbell, "Wichita Lineman." And all the song from the Bee Gee, from Beatle, Rolling Stone, I love.

When I was young I heard, you know, "California Dream." I thought, `Wow, San Francisco, everybody wearing their flower in their hair?' I make my wish: when I grow up, I like to come to United States. I like to live in San Francisco, see if I can get flower in my hair. That's a "California Dreaming," the song.

But when I come here in 1979--oh, it is hard. I have no relative. Just, like, a couple of friend. They help me. And I'm not able to be speaking very, very well. So every day when I am driving, I put a tape in my radio so I'm listening.
When you come to the country here, the easy way to be get in--get a job is to go to into the nail salon. That's why the population from Vietnam, they all do nail business."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shirley Temple died on February 10. 2014.   Watching the parade of clips from her 1930&#8217;s movies on tv that night brought back the magic she had as a child to delight and entertain. How many hours did we spend watching her tap her way through hard times and good?</p>
<p>It was actually Shirley Temple who triggered the story you&#8217;re about to hear. The year was 1999. I had been getting manicures for awhile at a Vietnamese nail shop in San Francisco from a woman named Shirley. Over the months I had come to know her a bit, she would ask about our radio shows, I would ask about her daughter Crystal. One day as we talked it occurred to me, why is this woman named Shirley? She is from Vietnam. There are no Shirley&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>When I asked how she came to be Shirley she told the most harrowing story of her passage to America as a young girl, her separation from her brother and mother as they escaped Vietnam by boat, how she washed ashore in America alone, sick and scared out of her mind, speaking no English.</p>
<p>She said in Vietnam her name was Hang, which means ‘Lonely woman looking at the moon&#8221; Hang was hospitalized In the hospital room she watched the black and white TV on the wall. Over and over she saw a little girl dancing, who was happy. She told herself she had to stop crying for her mother and brother. She was in America. She had to be happy too. Someone told her the little girl&#8217;s name was Shirley, Shirley Temple. So she took that name.</p>
<p>Shirley led us into her world. We spent months in Vietnamese nail salons, chronicling the lives of the women working there. Today we call this story “French Manicure: The Long Shadow of Shirley Temple&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen&#8230;..</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“Eel Pie Island was where they used to fish out the eel up through the 1960s. The eels would be sold in the front of fish monger shops, big, fat, some as thick as your arm, lying around on the marble slabs,” says actress Anjelica Huston who grew up in London in the 60s and made the pilgrimage to Eel Pie Island, an early rock ‘n roll mecca.

Anjelica Huston in the 1960s, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Small Faces, Manfred Mann, John Mayall, The Yardbirds, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, Cyril Davies and dozens more did some of the earliest gigs there in the 60s before they became international sensations.]]></description>

		<itunes:summary>We were in London, searching for hidden kitchens, when we came upon an Eel Pie and Mash shop.  These shops are now a dying breed, along with the eels they serve.  Our search for the source of these vanishing eels led us to southwest London, to Eel Pie Island, a tiny slice of land with a flamboyant history that stretches from Henry VII to The Rolling Stones.</itunes:summary>
