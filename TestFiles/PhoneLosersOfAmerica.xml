<p>Here&#8217;s a morning show that happened on Friday The 13th where I tried to make prank calls after playing a message that I&#8217;m calling them from prison.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashmere Sweater by Nerf Herder</li>
<li>Hire a voice artist at <a href="http://www.voice123.com">www.voice123.com</a></li>
<li>I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t tell that first guy that I was going to use the snow plow to break out of prison.  Stupid STUPID!</li>
<li>If you make prank calls, you should try making your calls come from prison.  The link to listen/download the prison message is phonelosers.org(slash)stuff(slash)chilipepper_prison01.mp3</li>
<li>Search all the Craigslist pages with <a href="http://www.searchtempest.com/">http://www.searchtempest.com</a></li>
<li>Thanks, Brittany, for being a jerk of a friend and sending me your friends phone numbers!</li>
<li>Shoutout to Lux, The Neediest Guy In The Chatroom!</li>
<li>Jason Scott is awesome.  He runs <a href="http://www.textfiles.com">www.textfiles.com</a></li>
<li>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to this show, learn how to subscribe to things.  Derr.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/snowplowshow">http://www.phonelosers.org/snowplowshow</a> has been sort of updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weird &#8211; the iPhone podcast version of this show kept showing up as the 16 second clip about calling from prison. Thanks, everyone, for alerting me to this problem. It seems to be working for me now that I&#8217;ve broken the prison link above and reposted this show. Let me know if you still can&#8217;t hear the show. HUGZ!</p>

I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t tell that first guy that I was going to use the snow plow to break out of prison.  Stupid STUPID!
If you make prank calls, you should try making your calls come from prison.  The link to listen/download the prison message is phonelosers.org(slash)stuff(slash)chilipepper_prison01.mp3
Search all the Craigslist pages with http://www.searchtempest.com
Thanks, Brittany, for being a jerk of a friend and sending me your friends phone numbers!
Shoutout to Lux, The Neediest Guy In The Chatroom!
Jason Scott is awesome.  He runs www.textfiles.com
If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to this show, learn how to subscribe to things.  Derr.
http://www.phonelosers.org/snowplowshow has been sort of updated.

Weird &#8211; the iPhone podcast version of this show kept showing up as the 16 second clip about calling from prison. Thanks, everyone, for alerting me to this problem. It seems to be working for me now that I&#8217;ve broken the prison link above and reposted this show. Let me know if you still can&#8217;t hear the show. HUGZ!</itunes:summary>

<p>This is Roy and Staci&#8217;s show, which happened during the 24 hour marathon on MadhouseLive.com.  There&#8217;s a LOT of us just talking in this and really no amazing pranks happen until about an hour into the show where Staci is in Wal-Mart and tells me who to call.  You should skip to 1 hour and 7 minutes to hear what happens with that, because it&#8217;s pretty funny.  And then go look at Staci&#8217;s YouTube and send her a message asking why the hell the video isn&#8217;t up yet.</p>

<p>Thanks for the above picture, Johnicek!  I&#8217;m calling this show The MC Ohm-I Hour because I think there was more of his music in this episode than pranks.  Be thankful that you missed this show live because you won&#8217;t have to listen to the nearly 2 hours of boring stuff that I removed from the final edit.  And the hour that&#8217;s left isn&#8217;t much better.  Gawd, why even bother listening to this.  Abort!  Abort!</p>

<p>If you tired of listening to the Kenny Loggins radio station and smashing into phone booths on GTA V alone, then you should join the <a href="http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/pla_radio">PLA Radio Crew</a> on Rockstar&#8217;s Social Club so we can all kill each other.  Some guy named Blackmscruggs set this up.  Why did he name it PLA Radio when there hasn&#8217;t been a new <a href="/radio/">PLA Radio</a> in decades now?  <b>WHO KNOWS!</b>  But search for &#8220;PLA Radio&#8221; on Rockstar&#8217;s social club or visit the link below to join.  Thanks, Blackmscruggs!</p>

<p>Last week I released a new song that covers some of our water-related antics with landlords.  This weekend I&#8217;ve completed a music video for the song, which is embedded above.  I thought that simply writing out the lyrics would be a quick and easy way to make a music video and holy crap was I wrong.  I spent a full week of evenings writing out all those words and then syncing them to the music.  NEVER AGAIN.</p>
<p>If you like this song, here are some links to download the song for free and listen to other songs by RB &#038; The CPs.</p>

<p>Also, my close personal friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dbestpdx">Derrik Best</a> has created the logo below, which I assume will adorn the high-tech machinery that this song will someday be responsible for.  Thanks, Derrik!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of our Tenants From Hell prank calls, below is a playlist containing all of our landlord prank calls, including the ones posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/omghaxdotnet/videos">Staci Stack&#8217;s channel</a>.  This playlist is around 2 hours long, so sit back and enjoy it for awhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/2013/stuffed_phone_booth.jpg" width="250" height="475" />This show starts out really slow, for the first 5 hours or so, but it&#8217;s worth it because RBCP gets married in this show.  I edited about half of the boringness from this show, but it&#8217;s still pretty long and boring.  Just skip this one.  Don&#8217;t even listen.  Why bother.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tonight I broadcast on the new Madhouse Mixlr, which is located at <a href="http://www.mixlr.com/madhouselive">www.mixlr.com/madhouselive</a>, and has a little less delay than the shoutcast streams on phonelosers.org and <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">madhouselive.com</a></li>

Tonight I broadcast on the new Madhouse Mixlr, which is located at www.mixlr.com/madhouselive, and has a little less delay than the shoutcast streams on phonelosers.org and madhouselive.com
I&#8217;m also broadcasting on YouTube streaming, but that only lasts about half of the show so I probably won&#8217;t do that again.

<p>This show got off to a slow start because none of the Twitter complainers were picking up except for a couple of them that weren&#8217;t funny.  You might notice some references to things that were cut out.  I removed nearly all of the Twitter complaining stuff so you don&#8217;t have to listen to an hour of fail.  The guitar solo at around 6 minutes indicates the first hour of the show that I cut out.  More than THREE HOURS was cut from the live show for the podcast feed.  There was a lot of people not answering and a lot of music, so you&#8217;re not missing much.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know your paid Skype account can spoof caller ID?  I mean, technically it&#8217;s not spoofing anything because it&#8217;s displaying <b>your</b> phone number, but Skype lets you choose multiple caller IDs from a drop-down box and can change them immediately for you if you need them to.  It&#8217;s really easy to do.  Let me walk you through the basics, then we&#8217;ll get into some fun stuff.</p>
<p>First, you go to <a href="http://www.skype.com">skype.com</a> and log into your account.  Since I have a paid account that includes both Skype-in and Skype-out, I&#8217;m unsure which of these 2 features you&#8217;ll need to change your caller ID.  I would assume that you only need the ability to dial out to land lines (Skype-out), which is $30 per year.  Incoming call service is an additional $30 per year.  You can pay much less if you pay by the month instead of by the year, but $60 for a year of phone calls is a great deal.</p>
<p>When you get to the main page, click on the button labeled Caller ID.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_log_in.png" alt="Log into Skype"></center></p>
<p>Once Skype&#8217;s infuriatingly slow page loads the caller ID page, you&#8217;ll see the phone number that Skype is currently displaying to the people you call.  That is, if you are currently displaying a number.  Mine is showing my Silicon Valley phone number, which I&#8217;ve blocked part of out so you weirdos don&#8217;t call me.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_display_this_number.png" alt="Display Skype Number"></center></p>
<p>You can click on the &#8220;Change Number&#8221; link to change the number to something new, or you can click on &#8220;Deactivate Caller ID&#8221; to stop Skype from showing your personal phone number.  When you deactivate the caller ID and you call someone, the person you&#8217;re calling will see a default Skype phone number, such as 661-748-0241.  </p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_receiving_call_from_unset_caller_id.jpg" alt="Receiving A Call From Skype"></center></p>
<p>Sometimes it displays different numbers, but they usually seem to be in the 661 area code.  When the person you&#8217;re calling attempts to return your call at this number, they will hear a recording stating, &#8220;This call could not be completed because you&#8217;re trying to reach a Skype user.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, land line users will sometimes see &#8220;Skype Caller&#8221; on their caller ID name display, especially when you&#8217;ve disabled your caller ID with Skype.  When you use your Skype phone number as your caller ID (the phone number that you&#8217;re actually paying Skype for) some home users will see your Skype user name.  Yes, your Skype user name!  This is why it&#8217;s a bad idea to use your Skype phone number as your caller ID if you want to be anonymous.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s click on &#8220;Change Number.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_choose_your_number.png" alt="Choose Your Skype Caller ID Number"></center></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be presented with a drop-down box showing all of the numbers that you&#8217;ve verified and saved that you can use for your caller ID.  Pick the one you want, click on the &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; button, and your caller ID is immediately displaying for everyone you call.  There appears to be no delay on this feature.  You can change it to any saved number as often as you want and it&#8217;ll immediately begin displaying for the people you call.</p>
<p>You can add numbers to your list of possible caller IDs, but the numbers you choose have to be able to receive text messages and you have to have access to the phone so you can read those text messages.  To put a new number in, click on the &#8220;Enter a new number&#8221; link.  You&#8217;ll get the screen below.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_enter_country_and_mobile.png" alt="Enter Your Skype Caller ID Number"></center></p>
<p>Choose the country your mobile number is located in, type in the area code and number, then click on &#8220;Verify Number.&#8221;  In a few seconds, you&#8217;ll receive a text message from Skype like the one below.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2013/skype_caller_id_verification_code.jpg" alt="Skype Verification Code"></center></p>
<p>Enter the code that was texted to you and prepare for a bit of disappointment because Skype will make you wait a full 24 hours before you can start using your new caller ID.  But once that 24 hours is up, you&#8217;re free to use it as often as you want.</p>
<p>So why have I created a tutorial that shows you how to do things that any Skype user should be able to figure out themselves?  Partly because a lot of people ask me how to do this, so now I can direct them to this page that will explain everything.  But the real reason is so that I can point out some ways to have fun with this.  </p>
<p>We all know that spoofing caller ID can be really useful, both in making prank calls and social engineering information from people.  Sites like spoofcard.com allow you to spoof calls from any number you want, even if it&#8217;s a number owned by someone else, which can be really fun.  Unfortunately this Skype thing doesn&#8217;t allow you to spoof any number, but it&#8217;d be pretty easy to get all kinds of phone numbers in your list, such as&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Burner Phones.</b> Take that old cell phone that you were using to deal meth with and confirm it with Skype.  It&#8217;s always good to have all of your outgoing phone calls linked to your drug ring.  Of course, you can also go to Wal-Mart and buy a super cheap prepaid cell phone, set it up, and confirm your Skype on it before throwing it in the river.</p>
<p><b>Display Phones.</b> But why waste your own money on a prepaid cell phone when you can simply confirm a cell phone store&#8217;s display phone to use on your Skype?  Yep, it&#8217;s as easy as walking into an Apple Store, getting the phone number of a display phone and having Skype send a text to it for you to write down.  If you don&#8217;t have internet on your phone, call a friend and have them log into your account for you.  Imagine that, all these people you prank call angrily calling back the Apple Store.  Just be sure to delete the text message from the display phone so those genius employees don&#8217;t figure things out.</p>
<p><b>Prank Victims.</b> Is leaving the house to change your caller ID just way too much effort for you?  Then find some random person on Facebook who&#8217;s posted their phone number in their status and have Skype send their confirmation code to them.  Now you place a call to the phone number that you sent the code to and say something like, &#8220;This is Verizon Wireless.  We understand you&#8217;ve been having problems with your cell phone.  No?  Well we sent a confirmation code via text message that should tell us if your phone is about to explode in a giant fireball.  Which code do you have there?  Yes, don&#8217;t worry your pretty little head that it says Skype on it.  It says that because Verizon owns Skype.  Derr.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine the hilarity of all of your prank victims calling up some completely random person who you tricked into reading a code you had texted to them.  Bonus points if you do this to someone you feel actually deserves the hassle of this.</p>
<p><b>Google Voice.</b> As I mentioned before, you can send these codes to any number that receives texts, such as Google Voice, Voxox, etc.  Of course, Google Voice makes you confirm a real phone number with them before you set up an account, but it&#8217;s still a nice option to have.  Voxox will give you a phone number that receives texts with a free account, letting you confirm a Google Voice or a Skype through it.</p>
<p><b>Your Friend&#8217;s Cell Phone.</b> You&#8217;d have to be a really awful friend to do this, but you could borrow your friend&#8217;s cell phone for a few seconds to write down the Skype confirmation code from it.  Or quickly forward the text to yourself before deleting it.  You are a terrible friend.  </p>
<p>You get the point, though.  You could amass a huge collection of caller ID numbers to use on your phone calls that don&#8217;t belong to you at all.  Just the idea that other people are having to deal with the fallout from your prank calls makes prank calling twice as fun.  Of course, you will still follow <a href="/rules/">THE RULES</a> of prank calling and not get yourself in trouble, right?  <b>RIGHT??</b></p>

<p>Fair warning on this one &#8211; nothing really amazing happens during this show.  Some breakers are shut off during the second half, but that&#8217;s about it.  Only listen to this show if you&#8217;re really really bored.</p>
<p><UL><br />
<LI>RBCP listens to girly music, then complains about the weather.<br />
<LI><a href="http://www.youtube.com/telephonefalls">Telephone Falls</a> is finished.<br />
<LI>A gigantic chunk of the show has been edited out, because it&#8217;s nothing but RBCP being annoyed that nobody is answering.<br />
<LI><a href="http://www.bootzilla.org">bootzilla.org</a> again!<br />
<LI>Around 30 minutes (which was actually around 2 hours of nobody picking up phone calls), the show turns into a conference with Legend, Darkstranger, Chris Ellerbeck, Domininininzo and others.<br />
<LI>Ha! Ha!<br />
</UL></p>
<p>Mentioned in this show was a short show that Rappy and RBCP did earlier in the month.  I&#8217;m going to go ahead and post that one here too.  I don&#8217;t usually post 2 shows at once, so I&#8217;m not sure how this will work on the podcast feed.  Hopefully podcast listeners will see both of the shows.  In the Rappy show we do some pizza calls and Rappy releases his brand new hit single.  Here is the video for it:</p>

A gigantic chunk of the show has been edited out, because it&#8217;s nothing but RBCP being annoyed that nobody is answering.
bootzilla.org again!
Around 30 minutes (which was actually around 2 hours of nobody picking up phone calls), the show turns into a conference with Legend, Darkstranger, Chris Ellerbeck, Domininininzo and others.
Ha! Ha!

Mentioned in this show was a short show that Rappy and RBCP did earlier in the month.  I&#8217;m going to go ahead and post that one here too.  I don&#8217;t usually post 2 shows at once, so I&#8217;m not sure how this will work on the podcast feed.  Hopefully podcast listeners will see both of the shows.  In the Rappy show we do some pizza calls and Rappy releases his brand new hit single.  Here is the video for it:

<p>The video above is the very first episode of our brand new, critically acclaimed, #1 hit TV show on the Fox network, called Telephone Falls.  It&#8217;s a show where I steal everyone else&#8217;s hard work and ideas and art and cram it all together in a 20 to 30 minute episode.  This episode features world-renowned prank call artists such as <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">Carlito from Madhouse Radio</a>, Stephen Petty from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/PettyPranks">Petty Pranks</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ifoxfirei">Liz Darwin</a> from The Internet.</p>
<p>The opening theme song is from an artist known as <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/bonecage">Bonecage</a>, who re-tooled the intro just for Telephone Falls.  You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-_7Qj-m0Oo">click here to listen to the full version of the song</a>, which includes a video put together by RBCP.  Thanks, Bonecage</p>
<p>Other songs in the show include <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3DNJtzFoDg">Come Inside Of Me, Jesus by Gerpy Gerpy</a> and I&#8217;ve Been Delayed by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TAS1000">TAS 1000</a>.  And some weird girl calling herself Vinnious Kreechum let me use an animation of hers to play during a scene.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Kreechum">Her YouTube is full of similarly disturbing videos and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wendywindow">her Facebook contains about a year&#8217;s worth of photoshops featuring RBCP and poop</a>.  Seek help, Vinnious.</p>
<p>Other contributors include <a href="http://www.facebook.com/darkstrangerr">Darkstranger</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/666hill0ck666">Matt Fucking Hillock</a>, <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a>, and some random people from Fiverr.  Thanks a ton, everybody, for helping out with Telephone Falls.</p>
<p>One thing I really love about doing this show is that it&#8217;s basically a giant art gallery of other people&#8217;s work.  This episode had drawings by Matt, animation by Kreechum, calls by various people and music by several artists.  I&#8217;m tricking you all into just looking at other people&#8217;s stuff for nearly a half hour!  If <b>you</b> have any artwork you&#8217;d like to see in a future episode, you can <a href="mailto:rbcp@phonelosers.org">email it to me</a> and I can try to fit it in someplace.  I think one of the coolest parts of doing this show might be that I can expose you all to a bunch of new things by other people.</p>
<p>A question that a lot of people have already asked is how Telephone Falls is animated.  I&#8217;m using a digital drawing pad to draw the characters and scenes on the computer, using software called <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook-pro/overview">Sketchbook Pro</a>.  Then I use <a href="http://www.reallusion.com/crazytalk/animator/">CrazyTalk Animator Pro</a> to animate the mouths, facial expressions and bodies of the characters.  CrazyTalk automatically does all the mouth animations for me when I import the prank call sound file into it.  Basically I do barely any animation myself, so don&#8217;t think that I have any skills when you watch this show.</p>
<p>I did animate a few things using animation software or just keyframes in Adobe Premiere (like dialing the phone in the intro or the fat people grabbing chicken legs), but just about everything in this video is done with CrazyTalk Animator.  There&#8217;s no way I would have attempted to do an animated show without software that does all the hard work for me, so thanks, CrazyTalk, for making this happen!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not sure how frequently I&#8217;ll be able to release these episodes.  I worked on this one for months, but a lot of that work was learning how to use CrazyTalk and other software.  I&#8217;ve learned a lot of stuff these past few months, and I&#8217;m hoping that each episode will be a little better as I learn how to use the software, so maybe by the time &#8220;season 2&#8243; comes around, things will look a bit nicer.  One thing I&#8217;m considering is releasing a few of the individual pranks as soon as I finish them instead of waiting for the next episode to come out.  That way I can get some feedback that might convince me to make some small changes or maybe even not include it at all because it sucks.  Maybe we can start up a voting system where YOU decide which pranks end up in the next episode.  Who knows, we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
<p>Speaking of criticism, I&#8217;m a huge fan of brutally honest criticism, so please leave a mean comment here letting me know what I could do better.  Tell me what you completely hated about the show so that I can hopefully make the next episode even better.  It&#8217;s okay, I promise I don&#8217;t have feelings.  And when you&#8217;re done with that, tell as many people as you can about this show.  Post this episode on every social network you possibly can.  If you don&#8217;t post this on your Facebook or Google+, then you clearly hate &#8216;Merica.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.afterthetone.org/">TheN</a> motivated me to make a brand new version of our yearly media pack.  So <b><a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/torrent/">HERE IT IS!</a></b>  What is the PLA Media Pack, you ask?  The PLA Media Pack is a giant, 36 gig archive of everything the PLA has ever done.  It includes videos, prank mp3 files, pictures, texts, ebooks, and more.</p>
<p>The major thing you&#8217;ll notice about the new version is that it includes all of the videos that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/phonelosersofamerica">I&#8217;ve put on YouTube</a> this past year, which accounts for most of the 10 extra gigs you&#8217;ll get.  You&#8217;ll also get all of the new live shows that have been happening lately, the few missing episodes of <a href="/phoneshow/">The Phone Show</a> that weren&#8217;t in the last one, and a few other miscellaneous things.</p>
<p>So go download it now!  And when it&#8217;s done downloading, seed it for awhile if you can.  I&#8217;ll do my best to seed it myself as much as possible.  Below is link where you&#8217;ll find the new 2013 Media Pack torrent, along with other torrents that you&#8217;ll probably want.  Share and enjoy!</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/site_images/divider_bell_stripes.png"></center></p>
<p>In other news&#8230;there are 2 new videos on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/phonelosersofamerica">PLA YouTube</a>, both of them collections of the new Facebook job reference pranks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a new Snow Plow Show!  But don&#8217;t get your hopes up, because it&#8217;s not the old Snow Plow that you all know and love.  I should have explained this on the show, but I forgot, so I&#8217;m going to do it here instead.  The old style of Snow Plow is dead because I don&#8217;t like doing that format for YouTube.  It&#8217;s way too much effort.  And I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of live shows lately, calling them random things like the Brent Westwood Pre-Show, the Madhouse Pre-Cum Show, the 4Loko and Tortilla Chips Show, etc.  I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a little confusing for some people.  So I&#8217;m just going to call any live show I do the Snow Plow Show.  I&#8217;m stealing the name from myself.  Yay!</p>

<p>Thanks, Gordo, for sending me the amazing prank call CD known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melba-Comes-Alive-Phone-Pranks/dp/B0000038RS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1366653399&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=melba+comes+alive">Melba Comes Alive</a>, which I haven&#8217;t heard since 1997.  And thanks, mysterious stranger in Nebraska for the post card.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the latest solo show by RBCP, which happened on Saturday night.  It includes lots of photo customers and the brand new patented PLA trick of calling people on Facebook and doing job reference checks on their Facebook friends.</p>

You should just skip the first 20 minutes because it&#8217;s a bunch of pointless rambling with no prank calls, but some fun stuff happens throughout the rest of the show.  Below is the video for the Goonies tribute song that is talked about a few times.</p>

<p>I did another preshow on Saturday night, once again for <a href="http://brentwestwood.com/">Brent Westwood&#8217;s show</a>.  This one drags on for a little over 2 hours and includes calls to video store customers, pizza survey calls and I bust a girl for smoking weed at her job, which is what the image above is referring to.  Near the end there&#8217;s a 2 hour break where Brent Westwood&#8217;s show happened, but there&#8217;s no indication of WHERE it happened, so you just hear me saying goodbye and then there&#8217;s a bunch of pranks right after that.  So if you&#8217;re a little confused, that&#8217;s why.  Enjoy the show!</p>
<p>In case anyone missed the announcement, <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">Madhouse Live</a> has moved to Sunday nights!</p>
